;;; Commentary:

;; Dynamic abbreviation expansion in the middle of a word.  For example, if
;; the cursor is on the letter 'b' in "foo_bar" and the word "foo_quux_bar" is
;; in the current or other buffers, "quux_" will be inserted.  You can cycle
;; through all expansions just like dabbrev.  This also works at the beginning
;; and end of words, although at the end it's not as smart as regular dabbrev;
;; e.g. you can't hit space and have it continue to add more text.

;; 03 Dec 2008 -- v1.0
;;                Initial release
