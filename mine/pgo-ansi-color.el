;; standard (identical to ISO/IEC 6429), which is freely available as
;; a PDF file. The "Graphic Rendition Combination Mode (GRCM)"
;; implemented is "cumulative mode" as defined in section
;; 7.2.8. Cumulative mode means that whenever possible, SGR control
;; sequences are combined (ie. blue and bold).

;; After installing the ansi-color EmacsLisp file, add the following
;; to your ~/.emacs file:

(autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on "ansi-color" nil t)

  (add-hook 'eshell-preoutput-filter-functions 'ansi-color-filter-apply) ;remove from output

  ;; M-x term and M-x ansi-term do their own hilighting. It makes no
  ;; sense to add ansi-color to these modes. If you still want to
  ;; investigate this, take a look at term-emulate-terminal. That is the
  ;; function where you would have to add your stuff.
