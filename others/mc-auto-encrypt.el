;;; Commentary:

;; I grabbed this code from Charles on the
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/wiki.pl?AutoEncrypt page.  It takes
;; advantage of the Local Variables auto evaluation feature in files.
;; By evaluating mc-auto-encrypt when a file is opened you can use
;; mailcrypt to encrypt a region of the file.

;; To start encrypting any plain text file add this to the bottom of
;; the file:

;; Local Variables:
;; eval: (mc-auto-encrypt)
;; End:

;; Note that you can tell Emacs to automatically evaluate code instead
;; of asking you. To do so, just add this to your .emacs (Note that you 
;; shouldn't do it for security reasons):

;; (setq enable-local-eval t) ;; VERY VERY DANGEROUS !!!

;; Take a look at the emacs info page on "File Variables" for details
;; on how to specify file local variables and what types of comments
;; you can place them in.

;; The mc-auto-encrypt function then gets evaluated when the file is
;; opened.  It sets up a before-save-hook and a buffer local
;; after-save-hook to handle the (d)encryption.

;; Known problems:

;; When you previously edited a file and adding the Local Variables 
;; without encrypting the file, this results in an error when opening
;; it with Emacs. The trick would be to check if the file has been
;; encrypted before trying to do so.

(require 'mailcrypt)

;; create a before-save-hook for auto encryption functions
(defvar before-save-hook nil
  "Hook run via defadvice before a buffer is saved.  This is a buffer
local hook.")

;;; Changes

;; 1.4 - corrected the function name, few other typos
;; 1.3 - released as a separate .el file
;; 1.2 - made the after-save-hook buffer local
;; 1.1 - improved handling of buffer modification with an after-save-hook
;; 1.0 - original version by Charles

;;; mc-auto-encrypt.el ends here
