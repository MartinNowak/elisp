(defconst dabbrev-hover-introduction
  "With dh-mode, when you are typing a long word, like
\\begin{equation}, you see a possible completion hovering next to what
you type. Press TAB to complete the completion.  This is similar to
Openoffice's behavior. The key TAB continues to work normally
otherwise. 



Add something like the following to .emacs, according to your tastes.
\(require 'cl)
\(require 'dabbrev-hover)
\(dabbrev-hover-install t t)


The first argument of t installs this mode globally, for all buffers.
The second argument of t installs the fancy TAB option described
above.  If you don't install the fancy version (or if you work on
non-windowed systems where the fancy version doesn't work at this
time), you can still dedicate a special key to do M-x dh-complete,
which completes to the shown expansion.

 (global-set-key \"\\C-cc\" 'dh-complete) to your .emacs. 

To uninstall in a running emacs, M-x dabbrev-hover-uninstall

;; IS AN INITIAL RELEASE, NO IDEA IF IT BREAKS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF DABBREV.EL

;; Buglet: You see undesirable "Scanning buffer" messages.  This

;; Bug : Uses dabbrev.el, No idea how it reacts  with dabbrev.el.

;; Bug: Fancy mode doesn't work in -nw'ed mode for some reason. 

;; Does it make more sense to do our stuff in post-command-hook for
;; self-insert commands, instead of a timer?
