;;;_ & Commentary:
;;;  ----------
;;
;;;_  * Description:
;;;   ------------
;;
;; This package provides commands that format right-margin block-style
;; comments in source code.  These are comments that appear to the
;; right of the code, and often span several consecutive lines.  On
;; each line, the comment is delimited by start and end delimiters,
;; and these are lined up with the delimiters on adjacent lines to
;; form a rectangular block. For example, in Emacs Lisp:
;;
;;   (if narrow-failure
;;      (progn                             ; If failure, move `top' down
;;        (set-buffer code-buffer)         ; and repeat the process. If
;;        (goto-char top)                  ; success, this `if' returns
;;        (forward-line 1)                 ; nil so the `while' terminates.
;;        (setq top (point))))
;;
;; Or, in C:
;;                                          /* If the leading char of the */
;;   if((String[0] != '0') ||               /* string is '0', then the    */
;;      (tolower(String[1]) != 'x' &&       /* number is probably in hex  */
;;       !isdigit(String[1]))){             /* or octal; that is, unless  */
;;     iRes = sscanf(String, "%ld", &Temp); /* the number is just zero.   */
;;
;; You can even format banner comments, like this:
;;
;;                                          /******************************/
;;                                          /* If the leading char of the */
;;   if((String[0] != '0') ||               /* string is '0', then the    */
;;      (tolower(String[1]) != 'x' &&       /* number is probably in hex  */
;;       !isdigit(String[1]))){             /* or octal; that is, unless  */
;;     iRes = sscanf(String, "%ld", &Temp); /* the number is just zero.   */
;;                                          /******************************/
;;
;; This minor mode provides 25 commands for formatting and
;; manipulating comments of this style.  See the documentation of
;; `bc-mode-doc' for a description.
;;
;; To submit bug reports, hit `C-c r C-b'.  See the documentation for
;; `bc-submit-bug-report' for more information.  Suggestions,
;; comments, etc., to <burgett@eecs.berkeley.edu>
;;
;;
;;;_  * Installation:
;;;   -------------
;;
;; Put this file somewhere where Emacs can find it (i.e., in one of
;; the paths in your `load-path'), `byte-compile-file' it, and add the
;; following to your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;   (autoload 'bc-mode "bc-mode"
;;   "Minor-mode for formatting right-margin block-style comments in
;;   source code." t)
;;
;;   (autoload 'bc-make-regexp "bc-mode"
;;   "Make a regular expression defining the comment syntax to use
;;   with bc-mode." t)
;;
;;   (autoload 'turn-on-bc-mode "bc-mode" "Turn on bc-mode unconditionally.")
;;
;;   (global-set-key "\C-xr;" 'bc-mode)
;;
;; To use bc-mode, you call the function `bc-mode'.  See the
;; documentation strings for the function `bc-mode' and for the
;; variable `bc-mode-doc'.
;;
;; There isn't much to customize.  See `User Variables', below.
;;
;;
;;;_  * Compatibility:
;;;   --------------
;;
;; This package is known to work with Emacs 19.28, through 19.34, and
;; XEmacs 19.14.  It may work with others, I haven't tried it.
;;
;; This package has been used succesfully with the following major
;; modes: cc-mode (c and c++), emacs-lisp-mode, and text-mode (using
;; file-local variables).
;;
;; This package is compatible with ksh-mode, but has the same problems
;; with the shell pattern matching operator that other functions do.
;; See the Bugs section below.
;;
;; This package also is known to work with perl-mode, and cperl-mode,
;; but older versions of those may trigger some bugs.  See the Bugs
;; section below for some workarounds.
;;
;; This package has been used succesfully with the following minor
;; modes: font-lock, auto-fill, filladapt, outline.  Compatibility
;; with other minor modes has not been tested.  If you use Kyle Jones'
;; filladapt.el, you must `require' that BEFORE bc-mode gets loaded.
;;
;;
;;;_  * Commands:
;;;   ---------
;;
;; NOTE: COMMENTS THAT BEGIN IN THE FIRST COLUMN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED BY
;; BC-MODE COMMANDS AS BLOCK COMMENTS.
;;
;; This is so you can comment out lines of code without bc-mode
;; thinking you want them formatted as block comments.  You can even
;; have comments in the right margin of such code and still format
;; them with BC commands.
;;
;; For a summary of commands and key bindings, see the documentation
;; string for `bc-mode' (do a `C-h m' or M-x describe-mode when
;; bc-mode is turned on, or do `C-h f bc-mode').  For more
;; information, see the documentation for the variable `bc-mode-doc'
;; (do `C-h v bc-mode-doc').

;;;========================================================================
;;
;;;_  * Wish List:
;;;   ----------
;;
;;; Complete Rewrite?
;;
;; Well, maybe not a complete rewrite.  But, like any program that has
;; some history, BC has built up a lot of vestigial organs (and
;; behaviors).  For a very long time, the main set of BC commands were
;; `squeeze', `shorter', `taller', `lower-flow', and `raise-flow'.
;; These are the commands that do lots of searching and computing to
;; try to find some "optimal" formatting and placement for the
;; comment.  More recently, the tab-oriented commands, `fill',
;; `wider', `narrower', and the non-reshaping movement commands, `up'
;; and `down', were added.  These commands do less computing and give
;; more control to the user.
;;
;; It has become clear that in practice these "dumber" commands are
;; the more useful.  The "smart" commands don't get used nearly as
;; often.  A rewrite of BC would start with a core functionality to
;; support the dumb commands, and could potentially simplify the code
;; significantly.  This is because the present code is based on
;; routines that were originally written to support the smart
;; commands.  When the dumb commands were added, many routines were
;; further *generalized* to support them as well.
;;
;;
;;; Commands
;;
;; Versions of `wider' and `narrower' with finer control, i.e., only
;; change the width by one column.  This could well obviate the more
;; complex commands `shorter' and `taller'.
;;
;; Additional editing and motion functions that treat comments like
;; little windows, ala `bc-beginning-of-line', `bc-kill-line', etc.
;;
;; bc-splice-comments: Find the bc-comment on or below point and join
;; it with the one above.
;;
;; bc-delete-indentation, bc-split-line.
;;
;;
;;; More General Comment Parsing
;;
;; It is clear that we want to be able to recognize more than one
;; comment syntax in a buffer.  C++ is the prime example of a language
;; with more than one comment syntax.  That feature has been copied
;; by Java and JavaScript as well.  In fact, a buffer containing
;; JavaScript always contains HTML as well, so there may be three
;; syntaxes to deal with.
;;
;;
;;; Generalized Ignoring
;;
;; Presently, BC ignores comments that start in the first column so
;; that it doesn't try to format commented-out code.  This could be
;; generalized to ignore any comment starting in `bc-ignore-column' or
;; before.  Setting this to -1 would allow BC to format all comments.
;;
;; I now feel that it would be much better if BC were able to format
;; comments that start in the leftmost column just like any others.  I
;; refuse, however, to give up the ability to preserve commented-out
;; code.  I do think it is possible to have both, it is just going to
;; be work to implement it.
;;
;;
;;; Membership Tags
;;
;; Sometimes you would like to have block comments on consecutive
;; lines, but currently bc-mode determines the extent of a comment by
;; looking for lines that have no comments.  Another way could be to
;; allow a `tag-character' to come immediately after the starting
;; delimiter.  Only comments with matching tag charaters would be
;; considered to comprise a block comment.  For example:
;;
;;  int index = 1;			    //@ Start at one because that is
;;					    //@ what Numerical Recipes does.
;;  TWVertexNodeIterator iterN(rG);		   //| Go through every node
;;  while (iterN)				   //| in the Edit graph.
;;  {				     //- If it's white it's a Steiner node so
;;    TWVertexNode *pN = iterN++;    //- it's moveable. However, don't pull it
;;    if ((pN->Color() == gr::White) //- if it only has one edge because it
;;				     //- will just get pulled on top of the
;;	   && (pN->Degree() > 1))    //- node at the other end of that edge.
;;
;; An alternative might be a comment-beginning char to indicate the
;; first line of each block comment.  For example:
;;
;;  int index = 1;			    //> Start at one because that is
;;					    //  what Numerical Recipes does.
;;  TWVertexNodeIterator iterN(rG);		   //> Go through every node
;;  while (iterN)				   //  in the Edit graph.
;;  {				     //> If it's white it's a Steiner node so
;;    TWVertexNode *pN = iterN++;    //  it's moveable. However, don't pull it
;;    if ((pN->Color() == gr::White) //  if it only has one edge because it
;;				     //  will just get pulled on top of the
;;	   && (pN->Degree() > 1))    //  node at the other end of that edge.
;;
;; Both of these seem pretty hard to read.  A blank line to separate
;; comments is desirable if space permits.  Still, there are times when
;; tighter spacing would be nice.
;;
;;
;;;_  * To Do:
;;;   ------
;;
;; Make `do-auto-fill' context sensitive.  If the comment has any code
;; to its left (for any line of the commment), assume it is a
;; right-margin comment and don't auto-fill until text exceeds
;; bc-G-rm-minus-stuff.
;;
;; `bc-moveit' should call `bc-cleanup-newlines' after deleting the
;; old comment and *before* inserting the newly formatted one.  To
;; this end, `bc-find-room' should ignore lines that contain no code
;; and are marked with the `bc-added-newline' property.
;;
;;
;;;_  * Could Do:
;;;   ---------
;;
;; It wouldn't be too hard to support center and right-justification.
;; Maybe this would be useful for banner comments.  `bc-put-text'
;; could run through the scratch buffer just before copying it to the
;; code buffer and look for the `justification' text property.  If
;; present, call the real `fill-individual-paragraphs'.
;;
;; Support for adaptive fill would be nice too.  It would probably
;; mean not using bc-fill-buffer and just using fill-buffer instead.
;; That in turn would require a post-scan of the buffer to collect the
;; various metrics about the fill.  Might take a performance hit.
;;
;;;_  * Bugs:
;;;   -----
;;
;;; Formatting Bugs:
;;
;; Like all Emacs' comment-handling commands, BC is confused by
;; comment characters that appear in strings.  The problem appears
;; worse in when using BC because it means that a block comment cannot
;; span any such line.  For example:
;;
;;  if (!os)				    // The string contains the C++
;;  {					    // comment starter (double
;;    cerr << "Error: //comment starter.";  // slash), so BC cannot properly
;;    return;				    // format this block comment. It
;;  }					    // will assume that the comment
;;					    // starts inside the string.
;;
;; You'll have the same problem with Emacs' built in commenting
;; commands, e.g., `indent-for-comment' (M-;).
;;
;;
;;; Compatibility Bugs:
;;
;; Auto-filling does not work with cperl-mode because that mode
;; defines its own auto-fill-function.  A workaround is to set
;; `auto-fill-function' in the mode hook.  This seems to work okay,
;; your mileage may vary:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook
;;  	      (function (lambda ()
;;  			  (turn-on-bc-mode)
;;  			  (setq auto-fill-function 'do-auto-fill))))
;;
;;
;; With older versions of perl-mode, indenting does not work properly
;; when bc-keymap-level is non-nil.  You can fix this by placing the
;; following in your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook
;;	     (function (lambda ()
;;			(setq indent-line-function 'perl-indent-command))))
;;
;; BC is compatible with ksh-mode, but has the same problems
;; with the shell # and ## pattern matching operators that other
;; functions do (comment functions, font-lock, etc.).  It will confuse
;; these operators for comment starters.  The behavior is at times
;; quite baffling.
;;
;;
;;; Other Bugs:
;;
;; Lots of non-serious but ugly behavior when formatting empty
;; comments.
;;
;; Not really a bug, but it seems to be impossible to define the rules
;; of reformatting so that narrowing, widening, raising, lowering,
;; etc., always do what you expect.  This is because there are usually
;; a huge number of ways that a comment could be fit into the space to
;; the right of the code.
;;
;; BC-mode is not very integrated with built-in emacs comment support
;; functions.  It isn't clear to me just what form this should take
;; -- I'm open to suggestions.
;;
;; In particular, `indent-sexp' messes up all right margin block
;; comments.  This doesn't look easy to fix, because the comments get
;; messed up deep in the bowels of `indent-sexp'.  One way I can see
;; of fixing this is to store the starting column of each comment in a
;; text property and then advise `indent-for-comment' to use that.
;; Additional hackery would be necessary to remove the text property
;; when you really do want the standard indentation.  Further, if the
;; user doesn't store the text properties with the file, `indent-sexp'
;; will mess up the comments next time the file is loaded.
;;

;; Hearty thanks are due to several authors for their high-quality
;; software tools for Emacs Lisp:

USING THE MINOR MODE:
=====================

  BC-mode is a minor mode for editing right-margin block-style
  comments in source code.  These are comments that appear to the
  right of the code, and often span several consecutive lines.  On
  each line, the comment is delimited by start and end delimiters, and
  these are lined up with the delimiters on adjacent lines to form a
  rectangular block. For example, in C:

                                       /* If the leading char of the */
   if\(\(String[0] != '0'\) ||            /* string is '0', then the    */
      \(tolower\(String[1]\) != 'x' &&    /* number is probably in hex  */
       !isdigit\(String[1]\)\)\){          /* or octal; that is, unless  */
     iRes = sscanf\(String, \"%ld\", &T\); /* the number is just zero.   */


  Commands provided by bc-mode fall roughly into three groups:
  formatting, editing, and motion:

  Formatting commands include
  ---------------------------
    `bc-fill' and `bc-squeeze'          Block fill the comment.
    `bc-raise' and `bc-lower'           Move the comment up or down
					   one or more lines.
    `bc-raise-flow' and                 Move the comment up or down,
    `bc-lower-flow'                        reformatting it if necessary.
    `bc-narrower' and `bc-wider'        Reformat the comment narrower
					   or wider.
    `bc-taller' and `bc-shorter'        Reformat the comment taller
                                           or shorter.

   Editing commands include
  ---------------------------
    `bc-kill-comment'                   Kill the text of the comment.
    `bc-copy-comment-as-kill'           Save the comment as if killed,
					   but don't kill it.
    `bc-yank' and `bc-yank-pop'         Yank from kill-ring and format
					   as comment.
    `bc-kill-line'                      Comment-sensitive version of
					   `kill-line'.
    `bc-open-line', `bc-newline',
    `bc-indent-new-comment-line',       Comment-sensitive versions of
    `bc-indent-according-to-mode'          their namesakes.

  Motion commands include
  ---------------------------
    `bc-beginning-of-line' and          Move to beginning or end of
    `bc-end-of-line'                       comment or code.
    `bc-backward-comment' and           Move one or more block comments
    `bc-forward-comment'                   backward or forward.



How BC-mode Formats Block Comments:
-----------------------------------
  BC's formatting commands move and reshape block comments.  BC
  considers a block comment to consist of all the comment text on
  consecutive lines that contain comments.  Two block comments must be
  separated by at least one line that contains no comment, or contains
  only a comment that starts in the first column.

  COMMENTS THAT BEGIN IN THE FIRST COLUMN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED BY
  BC-MODE COMMANDS AS BLOCK COMMENTS.

  This is so you can comment out lines of code without bc-mode
  thinking you want them formatted as block comments.  You can even
  have comments in the right margin of such code and still format them
  with BC commands.

  The current implementation of BC can only recognize one comment
  style at a time.  In languages like C++ and Pascal, BC can only
  format comments having the syntax with which bc-mode was turned on.
  To switch to another syntax, use the command `bc-mode' with a prefix
  argument \(C-u \\[bc-mode]\) and select the desired syntax.

  BC formatting commands reshape block comments \(while keeping them
  blocked\), subject to the space available to the right of the code.
  In some cases, BC adds blank lines in order to be able to fulfill a
  formatting request.

  BC commands decide how to format by examining the comment.  Much of
  the format of a block comment is determined by its first few lines.
  For example, a C++ comment can begin with any number of slashes.  BC
  commands will examine the first line of the comment \(unless it is a
  banner comment\) to decide how many slashes to use when reformatting
  the comment.  If it is a banner comment, the first line containing
  the text of the comment is used.

  Thus, if you decide your comment would look better with three
  slashes instead of two, add one to the beginning of the first line
  of the comment and type `\\[bc-fill]' \(bc-fill, or any other BC
  formatting command\).  The comment will be reformatted so that the
  start and end delimiters on each line match those on the first line.
  This works in other languages as well.  For example, in C your start
  and end delimiters may include any number of `*' characters,
  e.g. `/*** ***/'

  BC-mode determines the following things by examining the comment:

    If the first line of the comment meets the criteria of being a
    banner border, the comment is considered to be a banner comment
    and the border character is determined from this line.

    If the second line of a banner comment contains only whitespace
    inside the delimiters, a single whitespace-only line will be
    preserved at the top of the formatted comment.

    The effective start delimiter is taken from the first line of a
    non-banner comment, or the first text line of a banner comment.

    If that line has whitespace between the start delimiter and the
    text, that is considered part of the effective delimiter.

    The effective end delimiter is determined in the same way, but
    unfortunately, it is not possible to accurately preserve
    whitespace before the end delimiter.  Instead, the effective end
    delimiter will contain the same amount of whitespace as the
    effective start delimiter.  Additional spaces are added as
    necessary to align the end delimiters to `bc-right-margin'.

    In languages that have no comment end delimiter, the first line is
    checked for a faux end delimiter.  To qualify, the line must end
    with a string of characters that is the mirror image of the start
    delimiter (see below).  If one is recognized, it becomes the
    effective end delimiter.

    If a banner comment has a blank line at the bottom \(above the
    bottom border\), a single whitespace-only line will be preserved at
    the bottom of the formatted comment.

    A comment can have multiple paragraphs.  The paragraph separator
    is a \"blank line,\" meaning a line with a comment that contains
    only delimiters and whitespace.  Note the difference between this
    and a line that contains no comment at all, which is used to
    separate two block comments.  Multiple paragraphs within a block
    comment are filled individually, and a single \"blank line\" will
    be preserved to separate them.


Squeezing and Tabbing:
----------------------
  BC's formatting commands can be further divided into three
  subgroups: tabbing, squeezing, and moving.  Tabbing commands place
  the formatted comment at at \"tab-stop\".  Tabbing commands include
  `bc-fill', `bc-wider', and `bc-narrower'.

  Squeezing commands square up the comment to make it take up the
  fewest number of columns for a given number of lines, then place the
  comment as far to the right as possible.  Squeezing commands include
  `bc-squeeze', `bc-shorter', and `bc-taller'.

  Moving commands don't squeeze or tab, they format the comment as
  close as possible to its current shape and place it as close as
  possible to its current horizontal position.  Moving commands
  include `bc-raise', `bc-raise-flow', `bc-lower' and `bc-lower-flow'.

  Probably you will use the tabbing commands most often.  These tend
  to give comments a more formal appearance because the comments can
  be horizontally aligned with others above and below.  You can set
  tab stops individually (in lisp), or you can set them to a uniform
  spacing with the command `bc-set-tab-spacing'.  Large values of tab
  spacing force block comments into a smaller selection of horizontal
  positions make them more visually aligned.  Large values also make
  it more difficult to format a comment in a tight space.

  Use the squeezing commands to fit a comment into a tight
  right-margin space or to get the maximum amount of white space
  between the code and the comment.  For example, if you need to fit a
  comment into a right-margin space of 20 columns, the default tab
  spacing of 8 is generally too coarse for the kind of fine-tuning you
  need.  The answer is not to set the tab spacing to a very small
  value (though this would work), but to adjust the comment by
  increments of one line taller or shorter.

  Moving commands preserve the horizontal placement of the comment as
  much as they can.  Two of these commands, `bc-raise-flow' and
  `bc-lower-flow', do it without disturbing the code to the left.
  Sometimes they may hit a line of code that is too wide to allow the
  same horizontal placement.  When this happens they will place the
  comment just after the end of that line.  The result is that the
  comment is neither squeeezed nor tabbed.  (When called with a prefix
  argument `bc-fill' has a similar behavior.  It just doesn't move the
  comment vertically).  Usually you will want to finish a sequence of
  such commands with a `bc-fill' (no prefix argument) or `bc-squeeze'.
  The other two moving commands `bc-raise-flow' and `bc-lower-flow',
  always preserve the horizontal position of the comment, and
  sometimes insert blank lines to permit them to do so.

  Note that a comment can be forced to any column (if there is room)
  by adding or deleting spaces before the start delimiter of the first
  line of text.  When that line of the comment begins in the desired
  column, do `bc-fill' with a prefix argument \(C-u \\[bc-fill]\) to
  align the rest of the comment.


Banner comments:
----------------
  Banner comments are those that include a border comment line for the
  first and last lines of the block comment. For example, in C:

  if\(*pId\){                          /**===========================**/
    return pId;                      /**                           **/
  } else {                           /** This is a banner comment. **/
    return 0;                        /**                           **/
  }                                  /**===========================**/

  Banner comments may optionally include blank lines above and below
  the text, as the one above does.  Note also that effective
  delimiters with an extra `*' character were used.

  A comment on a line is considered to be a banner border if it
  consists entirely of the same character \(like the equal sign above\),
  and contains no whitespace anywhere inside the delimiters.  The
  character may be one that is found in the delimiters \(e.g. a `*' in
  C\) if desired.

  If a block comment has a top banner it is considered a banner
  comment.  It will be formatted with both top and bottom banners,
  whether or not the bottom border is initially present.  Either or
  both blank lines may be present, and they will be preserved
  independently.  Note that if a banner comment has a blank line above
  the bottom border, the bottom border must be initially present for
  it to be preserved.

  In languages that use only start delimiters , faux end delimiters
  may be added if desired.  For example, in Lisp, a comment begins
  with a semicolon and continues to the end of the line.  Semicolons
  may be added at the end of each line to provide a border:

     \(setq bc-mode t\)                ;;=============================;;
     \(bc-select-keymap t\)            ;;  This is a Banner comment   ;;
     \(bc-install-menubar\)            ;;  with faux end delimiters   ;;
     \(bc-sync-advice-enable\)         ;;=============================;;

  Faux end delimiters may be added independently of top and bottom
  banner borders.  When the comment is reformatted, the faux end
  delimiters will be maintained at the end of the line, rather than
  getting mixed in with the text of the comment.

  To qualify as a faux end delimiter, the string that ends the line
  must be an exact mirror of the start delimiter.  For example,
  suppose a language has comments that begin with `rem<' and continue
  to the end of the line.  The string `>mer' at the end of the line
  will be recognized as a faux end delimiter:

     \(setq bc-mode t\)       		rem<  Here is a comment	   >mer
     \(bc-select-keymap t\)   		rem<  with faux end	   >mer
     \(bc-install-menubar\)   		rem<  delimiters.	   >mer

  Optionally, the last character of the start delimiter and the first
  character of the faux end delimiter may be repeated any numbers of
  times:

     \(setq bc-mode t\)       		rem<<  Here is a comment >>>mer
     \(bc-select-keymap t\)   		rem<<  with faux end	 >>>mer
     \(bc-install-menubar\)   		rem<<  delimiters.	 >>>mer


Line Killing and Insertion:
---------------------------
  Several of bc-mode's editing commands provide comment-sensitive line
  killing and insertion.  These include `bc-kill-line',
  `bc-open-line', `bc-newline', and `bc-indent-new-comment-line'.  If
  point is in the code, these commands apply to the code and attempt
  to preserve the integrity of any block comment.  If point is in the
  comment, these commands attempt to minimally affect the code.

  When adding a new line to a block comment, The line insertion
  commands try to move following lines of the block comment down onto
  subsequent lines of code, without adding blank lines.  For example,
  suppose point is at the location denoted by `@':

    } else {			   /* Handle bit-valued i/o point.@*/
      if(iValue){
        gaIo_shadows[iShadow].iData |= 1;

  If the user types `bc-indent-new-comment-line' (\\[bc-indent-new-comment-line]), the new
  comment line will be inserted like this:

    } else {			   /* Handle bit-valued i/o point. */
      if(iValue){		   /* @*/
        gaIo_shadows[iShadow].iData |= 1;

  However, if the user types `bc-indent-new-comment-line' a second
  time, the line will be inserted like this:

    } else {			   /* Handle bit-valued i/o point. */
      if(iValue){		   /*  */
                                   /* @*/
        gaIo_shadows[iShadow].iData |= 1;

  This is because the third line of code extended past the starting
  column of the block comment.

  Suppose, however, that you would have preferred the third line of
  the comment to be appended to the third line of code in such a case.
  This is controlled by the variable `bc-code-width-threshold'.  The
  above example assumes the default value of zero.  Setting this
  variable to a value of six or more would have caused the comment to
  be appended to the code on the third line, because the code is six
  columns wider than the comment's starting column.  Had the line
  exceeded this threshold, a blank line would still have been
  inserted.

  A small value (like six) allows appending comments to lines that are
  just a little too wide, and forces a blank line to be inserted for
  lines of code that are very wide.  A small negative value causes BC
  to maintain some separation between the code and the comment.  In
  practice, the setting of this variable is not terribly important,
  because you will probably clean up your comments with a BC
  formatting command after editing them.


Auto Fill:
----------
  BC has some rudimentary support for `auto-fill-mode'.  If you turn
  on both bc-mode and auto-fill-mode, auto-filling is modified so that
  comments and code disrupt each other as little as possible.

  If you use this, you will probably want to set `fill-column' to just
  a few less than `bc-right-margin'.  For example, in C the comment
  end delimiter is `*/'.  If you use the default value of
  `bc-right-margin' \(79\), and if you like a space before the end
  delimiter, set `fill-column' to 79 - 3 = 76.  You can do this by
  typing `M-7 M-6 \\[set-fill-column]'.  Or you may want to use a major-mode hook
  to set this from Lisp.

  If you want to use both bc-mode and auto-fill-mode, but do *not*
  want this behavior, set the variable `bc-enable-auto-fill-advice' to
  nil.  You can toggle this variable interactively with the function
  `bc-toggle-advice-enable'.

Keymaps:
--------
  You can select from two keymaps for bc-mode to use.
  `bc-mode-basic-map' is a minimally intrusive set of bindings for
  BC's most powerful functions.  `bc-mode-extended-map' adds
  additional bindings for cursor motion commands.  These commands
  override some standard commands, such as `beginning-of-line' \(bound
  to C-a, Home, etc\).  BC's versions of these commands behave like the
  standard ones when point is outside a block comment, and move within
  the comment otherwise.

  To select a keymap interactively, use the function
  `bc-toggle-keymap-level'.  This sets the value of the variable
  `bc-keymap-level' and updates the current keymap.  Alternatively you
  can set the value of `bc-keymap-level' in lisp.  A value of nil
  selects `bc-mode-basic-map'; non-nil selects `bc-mode-extended-map'.

Variables controlling bc-mode:
------------------------------
  `bc-right-margin'
     Right-margin for block comments.
     Default: 79
  `bc-keymap-level'
     Select keymap level to use with BC minor mode.
     Default: nil
  `bc-code-width-threshold'
     Amount by which the width of a line of code may exceed the
     current line's for line-insertion commands to move comments onto
     it.
     Default: 0
  `bc-tab-stops'
     List of tab stops to use in each buffer.
     Default: (1 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72)

  Other variables:
  ----------------
  `bc-enable-auto-fill-advice'
  `bc-enable-fill-paragraph-function'


  For convenience `bc-mode' sets the following variables if they are
  unbound.  BC does not otherwise use these because it has its own
  internal equivalents:

  `comment-start'
     String to insert to start a new comment.
  `comment-end'
     String to insert to end a new comment.
  `comment-start-skip'
     Regexp to match the start of a comment plus everything up to its body.


Hints:
------
  `bc-wider'  \(\\[bc-wider]\) and `bc-narrower' \(\\[bc-narrower]\) are conceptually the
  inverse of each other, but sometimes leave extra blank (except for
  the comment) lines.  Use `bc-lower' \(\\[bc-lower]\) to suck the code back from
  down below.

  If you can't get a comment moved to where you want with `bc-raise'
  \(\\[bc-raise]\) and `bc-lower' \(\\[bc-lower]\), try `bc-kill-comment' \(\\[bc-kill-comment]\) and
  `bc-yank' \(\\[bc-yank]\).

  If you can't make a comment narrow enough with `bc-narrower' \(\\[bc-narrower]\),
  try `bc-taller' \(\\[bc-taller]\), or `bc-squeeze' \(\\[bc-squeeze]\).

  To join two comments into one, go to the comment-free line that
  separates them and do `indent-for-comment' \(\\[indent-for-comment]\), which will add
  comment delimiters to the end of that line and move point just
  inside.  Then do `bc-kill-line' \(\\[bc-kill-line]\) to suck the lower comment
  up into the newly created line.

  To separate a comment into two, go to the beginning of the comment
  text on the line where you want to split and do `bc-open-line'
  \(\\[bc-open-line]\). This will leave a line with only delimiters, which can
  then be deleted with `kill-comment' \(\\[kill-comment]\).

  To add a banner to a comment, go to the line just above it and do
  `indent-for-comment' \(\\[indent-for-comment]\). \(Be careful not to inadvertently glue
  two comments together\).  Delete any whitespace between the comment
  delimiters \(not necessary if there is no end delimiter\).  If you now
  do a formatting command \(e.g. `bc-fill'\) a banner will be
  constructed of characters from the delimiters \(e.g the semicolon in
  Lisp\).  If you want a different character \(e.g. an equal sign\),
  first type that between the delimiters, with no whitespace.

  To remove a banner from a comment, delete the top banner and its
  delimiters.  Then do a BC formatting command, like `bc-fill' \(\\[bc-fill]\).

  To add a right-hand border of faux end delimiters, go to the first
  line of text in the comment and add a faux delimiter at the end.  Do
  a BC formatting command, and faux delimiters will be added to the
  end of each line in the comment.


CALLING THE FUNCTION BC-MODE:
=============================

  The function `bc-mode' toggles bc-mode.  Behavior of that function
  depends on whether it is called interactively or from Lisp.

Interactive Command:
--------------------
  If called interactively, the user may turn bc-mode on or off, and
  optionally select a comment syntax.

  With no prefix argument, calling `bc-mode' toggles bc-mode.  If the
  minor mode has never been on in the current buffer, calling with no
  argument is equivalent to calling with a non-negative prefix
  argument.

  With a non-negative prefix argument, the user is prompted to choose
  a language to define the desired comment syntax.  An initial guess
  is placed in the minibuffer, based either on the current major mode
  \(if bc-mode has never been turned on in this buffer\), or the value
  from the last time bc-mode was on in the buffer.

  With a negative prefix argument, bc-mode is turned off.


Lisp Function:
--------------
  From Lisp, `bc-mode' is called as follows:

    \(bc-mode &optional ARG\)

  The simplest way to invoke `bc-mode' from Lisp is to call it with no
  arguments.  The minor mode will be toggled.  If the minor mode has
  never been on in the buffer, a comment syntax will be guessed from
  the major mode and bc-mode will be turned on.  If a guess cannot be
  made, an error is signalled.  If the minor mode has previously been
  on in the buffer, it will use the same comment syntax as before.

  For convenience, the function `turn-on-bc-mode' turns on bc-mode
  unconditionally.

  The argument ARG can be supplied to exert more control.  It may be a
  number, a string, or a symbol.

    If a number, non-negative turns bc-mode on, negative turns it off.
    When the mode is turned on, the comment syntax is guessed if this
    is the first time, otherwise the previous syntax is used.

    If ARG is a string, it must be a regular expression describing the
    comment syntax.  BC-mode is turned on.  For most languages, this
    regular expression can be generated automatically by the function
    `bc-make-regexp'.  Also see the documentation for the variable
    `bc-comment-regexp'.

    If ARG is a symbol, it must be one of the keys in
    `bc-languages-alist'.  BC-mode is turned on and the corresponding
    comment syntax is used.

  If either `comment-start' or `comment-end' is not a string, an
  attempt is made to set them appropriately.


Examples:
---------
  The following might be put in your ~/.emacs:

  \(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'turn-on-bc-mode\)    ; Syntax will be guessed
						; from major mode.

  \(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook		        ; Turn on bc-mode but
	    \(function \(lambda \('bc-mode 'c\)\)\)\)	; use C style comments.


  If you program in a language that bc-mode does not know, you can
  call `bc-make-regexp' to build a comment syntax for you.  Suppose
  your language begins comments with \"<*\" and ends them with \"*>\".
  You could add the following to your ~/.emacs:

  \(add-hook 'my-lang-mode-hook
	    \(function \(lambda \(\)
			\(bc-mode \(bc-make-regexp \"<*\" \"*>\"\)\)\)\)\)

  You can also turn on bc-mode using File Local Variables.  If the
  language is known to BC, you can use the following format.  For
  example, at the end of a shell script, the following lines invoke
  bc-mode whenever the file is loaded:

    # Local Variables:
    # bc-language: csh
    # mode: bc
    # End:

  Note that the line for `bc-language' must come before the `mode'
  line.

  In the case that the language in the file is not known to BC, you
  must use the `eval' construct:

    # Local Variables:
    # eval: \(bc-mode  \(bc-make-regexp \"<*\" \"*>\"\)\)
    # End:

  If your language has no comment-end string, i.e., comments continue
  to end-of-line, pass only the comment-start string to
  `bc-make-regexp'.

  Note that `bc-make-regexp' will set up `comment-start' and
  `comment-end' if they are not already strings.  It does this by
  appending a space to its first argument and prepending a space to
  its \(optional\) second argument.")

  "Alist mapping languages to comment syntax information.

The keys are symbols denoting languages; the values are alists
containing language information.  Each of these alists may contain the
following keys:

    `delim'         The value is a list of strings.  The first
                    string contains the comment start delimiter
                    \(without any whitespace\).  An optional second
                    string contains the comment end delimiter, if the
                    language has one.

    `regexp'        The value is a list of one string.  It is an
                    explicit regular expression defining the comment
                    syntax.  It is only necessary in special
                    circumstances.  In most cases, a regular
                    expression can be computed from the `delim' field.")

(defvar bc-code-width-threshold 0
  "*Used by line-inserting commands such as `bc-open-line' to decide
whether a new comment line can be added to the left of the code on a
line below, or if a blank line must be inserted.  If the width of the
code on a subsequent line is less than the starting column of this
comment plus `bc-code-width-threshold', no blank line is inserted.
Otherwise blank lines are inserted before the too-wide line.

Setting this to a large negative value, like -999, causes blank lines
to always be inserted, in the manner of the standard
`indent-new-comment-line' (\\[indent-new-comment-line]) command.
Setting this to a large positive value, like 999, causes blank lines
to never be inserted.

Good choices for this variable are zero and small positive and
negative integers.  In particular, a value of zero will cause blank
lines to be inserted only when necessary to allow the new comment line
to line up under the previous one.

we must be careful not to move a comment to a line where the code ends
in that character.

It is further neccessary because if the comment-start string is all
the same character, you can add another and the whole string still
begins with comment-start.  If a line of code were to end with this

delimiter, in cases where a delimiter char is repeated (e.g. more than
one semicolon in Lisp).  It can be assumed that all searches based on
this regexp will be confined to one line, so the regexp itself does
not need to be concerned with matching newline characters. (e.g. in
Lisp, the comment-end delimiter is a newline, but `bc-comment-regexp'
needn't try to match it.)  In addition, `bc-comment-regexp' must
contain a substring match which matches only the text of the comment,
excluding delimiters and leading whitespace.

BC-mode's tabbing commands use tab stops to position the comment.
These tab stops are kept in the variable `bc-tab-stops'.  To set
individual tab stops you have to use Emacs Lisp, but you can set all
tab stops to a uniform spacing with this function.  The previous list
of tab stops is lost.  The spacing size will be determined by SPACING,
except that a tab stop will be placed at column 1 instead of column
zero.

  "Find a comment shape and a place it will fit.

INITIAL-COLUMN specifies the placement (and therefore width) of the
first try.  If this is less than the width of the code on the current
line, the first attempt places the comment just past the code.

COMM-RANGE-BEG and COMM-RANGE-END should specify the extent of any
comment presently in the search range.  These are passed to
`bc-find-room'.

If LIM-TOP is non-nil, it should be a buffer position of the beginning
of the line limiting the upper range of the search.  (The comment may
be placed on this line but not above.)

The value of INSERT-AFTER is used only if we are forced to insert a
blank line to support the first line of the comment.  If non-nil, that
blank line will be inserted after the line containing point, otherwise
before it.  Additional blank lines will be inserted as needed,
adjacent to the first one.

  ;; Let me start by saying that this particular function is a
  ;; God-awful beast.  It's complexity has gotten *way* out of hand
  ;; and even I don't really know how it works anymore.  I would love
  ;; to rewrite it.  I think that one reason for its complexity is
  ;; that it tries to be exhaustive in its search for a place to put
  ;; the comment.  This is partly a holdover from the days before BC
  ;; acquired the ability to insert blank lines to make room for the
  ;; comment.

  ;; The algorithm is as follows. A series of trials are performed. On each
  ;; trial, the comment is filled to a given fill-column and its height is
  ;; taken. bc-find-room is then called to find that many lines and returns
  ;; the width of the available right-margin space in those lines. If this
  ;; is wide enough for the fill-column of the comment text, we are
  ;; done. If not, the comment is re-filled at that width and the process
  ;; is repeated. Thus, in this series of trials the comment is repeatedly
  ;; narrowed to see if a fit can be found.
  ;;
  ;; During these trials no minimum required width is passed to
  ;; bc-find-room. At some point in these trials (unless we have
  ;; success), the comment will eventually reach its minimum fillable
  ;; width. When this occurs, max-code-width is set and a new set of
  ;; trials is begun. On each of these, max-code-width is repeatedly
  ;; reduced which allows the comment fill-column to increase and its
  ;; height to decrease. If max-code-width drops below the width of
  ;; the code on the current line, an exception is thrown to 'failure.

  "Finds available space for right-margin comments in the neighborhood

The function tries to expand the range of lines from FIRST-LINE to
LAST-LINE to include LINES-NEEDED lines such that the widths of
those lines are all less than or equal MAX-CODE-WIDTH.  LAST-LINE
may be nil to indicate that no range has been acquired yet.

If successful, function returns \(first-line last-line code-width\), where
`first-line' and `last-line' indicate the new range, and `code-width'
indicates the width of the widest line of code in the range.

If the search area contains a comment that is currently being
formatted, we don't want this to be mistaken as being in the way.
COMM-RANGE-BEG COMM-RANGE-END must be supplied to indicate where the
comment currently lies.  Both are buffer positions of beginnings of
lines.

If there is not enough room (because of buffer limits, wide code, or
adjacent comments), function returns ('failure reason lines-avail
first-line code-width), where 'lines-avail' is a count of how many
lines did fit."

A zero NARROW argument causes only rectangular blocking.  Negative
values cause the fill-column to be increased to make the text occupy
one less line.  Positive values cause the fill-column to be reduced,

(defun bc-analyze-comment (start end &optional save-delims)
  "Examine the right-margin comment on the lines between START and END.
Determines the effective comment delimiters.  For example, in Lisp the
comment-start string is a single semicolon, but a comment may start
with more than one.  If so we want the effective comment-start string
to have that many semis.

This function also determines whether the comment has a banner.

Returns \(new-start new-end width new-first new-last column\), where
`new-start' and `new-end' indicate the range of the comment minus
banner and empty lines.  `width' indicates the width of the comment,
defined to be maximum of the widths of the text \(excluding
delimiters\) on each line.  `new-first' and `new-last' indicate the
range of the comment minus banner lines.  `column' indicates the
starting column of the comment, as determined by the start delimiter
of the first text line of the comment.

If SAVE-DELIMS is non-nil, delimiters and their column positions are
recorded in the global variable `bc-saved-delims'.  The format is a
list of elements, each recording delimiter information for one line.
The first element of the list corresponds to START.

Two types of elements are used: one for banners and one for the rest
of the comment.  For banners, each element has the form \(column
banner\),where `column' indicates the column in which the start
delimiter begins on that line, and `banner' contains all of the
comment on that line, including delimiters.

For the rest of the comment, each element has the format \(column
start end\), where `start' and `end' are the effective delimiters,
including whitespace.

Sets global variables: `bc-effective-start', `bc-effective-end',
`bc-G-rm-minus-stuff', `bc-banner-top-border', `bc-banner-top-space',
`bc-banner-bottom-space', `bc-banner-bottom-border', `bc-extra-lines',

  "Saves the location of point so that it can be put back in a sensible fasion
after a bc formatting command.  If point is not inside the comment
when the command is called (i.e. it is in the code), we want point to end up
in exactly that place in the code afterward.  If, on the other hand, point is
inside the comment, then we want it to end up at the same place in the comment
afterward.  Both of these will be, in general, quite different from simply
returning point to the same character position in the buffer \(as with
save-excursion\).

CURRENT-POINT is the buffer position to be saved.  The other four
arguments are the buffer positions of the beginnings of lines.

If STICK-TO-DELIMS is non-nil, it effects the count of non-whitespace
characters returned when the result is ('in-comment 'in-end-delimiter
count).  Normally the characters are counted to the center of the
comment text on the line.  If this argument is non-nil they are
counted to the end of the comment text on the line.

This function returns a structure which can be used by
`bc-restore-excursion'.  Its structure is a list of three elements:
\(`vert' `horiz' `pos'\).

`vert' will be one of the following: 'in-top-banner, 'in-bottom-banner
'in-top-space, 'in-bottom-space, 'in-comment, 'in-code, or
'past-comment.

If `vert' is 'in-code, `horiz' is the line number and `pos' is the
column. If `vert' is 'past-comment, `horiz' is the line number and
`pos' is nil.

Otherwise, `horiz' will be one of the following: 'in-start-delimiter,
'in-text, 'in-end-delimiter, or 'past-end.

If `vert' is one of 'in-top-banner, 'in-bottom-banner 'in-top-space,
or 'in-bottom-space, `pos' has a value depending on `horiz':

       HORIZ                                  POS
-------------------	----------------------------------------------------
'in-start-delimiter	Count of character columns from beginning of start
'in-text		delimiter to point.

'in-end-delimiter	Count of columns from beginning of end delimiter.


If `vert' is 'in-comment, `pos' has a value depending on `horiz':

       HORIZ                                  POS
-------------------	----------------------------------------------------

'in-end-delimiter	point is into the comment as a count of non-whitespace
			characters, and `column' indicates in which column of
			the delimiter point is.

			\(`count' . `whitep'\) where `count' indicates how far
