;;; Commentary:

;; This file  includes the command  `exec-abbrev-cmd' which lets you  execute a
;; command by  giving it in an  abbreviated form, where  the abbreviation takes
;; the first character of each word in the command name.  For example "g" is an
;; abbreviation  for   the  command  `gnus',   "eb"  is  an   abbreviation  for
;; `emms-browser' and "omm" is an abbreviation for `outline-minor-mode'.  If an
;; abbrev contains hyphens the number of  words in the command match the number
;; of hyphens  plus one.   So the  abbrev "o-m-m" is  equivalent to  the abbrev
;; "omm".   Of course  it is  possible,  that an  abbreviation matches  several
;; commands, e.g. "g" matches not only  `gnus' but `grep', `gdb' and some more.
;; In such cases you will be queried, which command to use.
;;
;; When you hit TAB on the exec-abbrev-cmd prompt, you'll fall back to the
;; normal behavior of `execute-extended-command' with the current minibuffer
;; contents as initial input.
;;
;; To have this  functionality quickly accessible you might want  to bind it to
;; some key.  That's what I use:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp") ;; Where is exec-abbrev-cmd.el?
;;     (require 'exec-abbrev-cmd)         ;; Load it.
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x x") 'exec-abbrev-cmd)
;;     ;; Since you can fall back to normal `execute-extended-command' behavior
;;     ;; with TAB, its perfectly ok to bind `exec-abbrev-cmd' to `M-x'.
;;     ;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'exec-abbrev-cmd)
;;
;; Now you'll say,  "Wow, what a nice feature!", but  it's even getting better.
;; Let's say  you often invoke  `customize-face' with `C-x  x cf RET'  and then
;; choosing from the completion  list between `copy-file' and `customize-face'.
;; Always `copy-file' is selected  first, because it's lexicographically before
;; `customize-face'.     As    a    solution    to   this    problem    there's
;; `exec-abbrev-cmd-mode', a global minor  mode that does bookkeeping how often
;; you invoke  a command with `exec-abbrev-cmd',  so that the  list of commands
;; you have  to choose from is  sorted by the frequency  of command invokation.
;; After a while in most cases `C-x x <abbrev> RET RET' will do what you want.
;;
;; If you want to enable this feature put this in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;     (exec-abbrev-cmd-mode 1)
;;
;; Have fun!

;;; Notes:

;; You should have a look  at `partial-completion-mode' which comes with emacs,
;; too. I like this  mode better because `partial-completion-mode' doesn't play
;; well with `ido-mode', but your mileage may vary.
