;;; Commentary:

;; This lets you quickly burn files and directories to CD or DVD.
;; Copy cdvdmacs.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:

;;     (require 'cdvdmacs)

;; M-x cdvdmacs-add adds a file or directory to the project. A new
;;     project is created if none exists. In dired, "M-i a" adds the
;;     file at point, and "M-i m" adds all marked files.
;; M-x cdvdmacs-create-iso creates an ISO image of the project.
;; M-x cdvdmacs-burn-cd and ...-dvd burn the project on-the-fly.
;; C-d and DEL in the speedbar frame remove a file from the project.

;; Burning commands are currently hard-coded; adapt them if necessary.
