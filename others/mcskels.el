;; Notes about `mc-comp-list':
;;
;;   `mc-comp-list' is a list of completions for c statements after
;;   statements is passed to `mc-insert-stat-complete' it will look-up
;;   for a symbol mc-<stat>-skel. If it is variable, then
;;   `mc-insert-skeleton' will be called, else if it is function then
;;   it will be called interactively.
;;
;; Notes about `mc-push-stack':
;;
;;   `mc-push-stack' is a stack of cursor points. You can use it to
;;   enhance speed of cursor moving inside skeleton.

;;; Customisation:
;;
;; You can add your stats to `mc-comp-list', Do not forget to describe
;; action for it.

;; Errors in format [code name short-desc long-desc]
(defvar mc-errors-list
  (list [0 "Undefined error." "Not used."]

	[1 "EPERM" "Operation not permitted." "An attempt was made to
perform an operation limited to processes with appropriate privileges
or to theowner of a file or other resources."]

	[2 "ENOENT" "No such file or directory."  "A component of a
specified pathnamedid not exist, or the pathname was an empty
string."]

	[3 "ESRCH" "No such process."  "No process could be found
corresponding to thatspecified by the given process ID."]

	[4 "EINTR" "Interrupted function call."  "An asynchronous
signal (such asSIGINT or SIGQUIT) was caught by the process during the
execution of an interruptible function.  If the signal handler
performs anormal return, the interrupted function call will seem to
have returned the error condition."]

	[5 "EIO" "Input/output error."  "Some physical input or output
error occurred. This error will not be reported until a subsequent
operation on the same file descriptor and may be lost (over written)
by any subsequent errors."]

	[6 "ENXIO" "No such device or address."  "Input or output on a
special file referred to a device that did not exist, or made a
request beyond the limits of the device.  This error may also occur
when, for example, a tape drive is not online or no disk pack is
loaded on a drive."]

	[7 "E2BIG" "Arg list too long."  "The number of bytes used for
the argument and environment list of the new process exceeded the
current limit of 65536 bytes (NCARGS in <sys/param.h>)."]

	[8 "ENOEXEC" "Exec format error."  "A request was made to
execute a file that, although it has the appropriate permissions, was
not in the format required for an executable file."]

	[9 "EBADF" "Bad file descriptor."  "A file descriptor argument
was out of range, referred to no open file, or a read (write) request
was made to a file that was only open for writing (reading)."]

function was executed by a process that had no existing or
unwaited-for child processes."]

	[11 "EDEADLK" "Resource deadlock avoided." "An attempt was
made to lock a system resource that would have resulted in a deadlock
situation."]

	[12 "ENOMEM" "Cannot allocate memory." "The new process image
required more memory than was allowed by the hardware or by
system-imposed memory management constraints.  A lack of swap space is
normally temporary; however, a lack of core is not.  Soft limits may
be increased to their corresponding hard limits."]

	[13 "EACCES" "Permission denied." "An attempt was made to
access a file in a way forbidden by its file access permissions."]

	[14 "EFAULT" "Bad address." "The system detected an invalid
address in attempting to use an argument of a call."]

	[15 "ENOTBLK" "Not a block device." "A block device operation
was attempted on a non-block device or file."]

resource which was in use at the time in a manner which would have
conflicted with the request."]

pathname existed, but it was not a directory, when a directory was
expected."]

	[21 "EISDIR" "Is a directory." "An attempt was made to open a
directory with write mode specified."]

supplied.  (For example, specifying an undefined signal to a signal(3)
or kill(2) function)."]

	[23 "ENFILE" "Too many open files in system." "Maximum number
of file descriptors allowable on the system has been reached and a
requests for an open cannot be satisfied until at least one has been
closed."]

	[24 "EMFILE" "Too many open files." "<As released, the limit
on the number of open files per process is 64.> The getdtablesize(2)

	[28 "ENOSPC" "Device out of space." "A write(2) to an ordinary

a directory entry failed because no more disk blocks were available on
the file system, or the allocation of an inode for a newly created
file failed because no more inodes were available on the file
system."]

	[29 "ESPIPE" "Illegal seek." "An lseek(2) function was issued
on a socket, pipe or FIFO."]

	[30 "EROFS" "Read-only file system." "An attempt was made to
modify a file or directory on a file system that was read-only at the

protocol family has not been configured into the system or no
implementation for it exists."]

	[47 "EAFNOSUPPORT" "Address family not supported by protocol

been shut down with a previous shutdown(2) call."]

	[60 "ETIMEDOUT" "Operation timed out." "A connect(2) or
send(2) request failed because the connected party did not properly
respond after a period of time.  (The timeout period is dependent on
the communication protocol.)"]

	[61 "ECONNREFUSED" "Connection refused." "No connection could

This should only be used for user's data & not system files."]
