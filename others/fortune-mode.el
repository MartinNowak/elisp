;;; Commentary:
 
;; This file defines a major mode and associated functions for editing
;; fortune files, i.e. files containing quotations separated by `%'
;; characters.  It can be used in one of two ways.  The first is as a
;; major mode when editing such files directly.  Since such files do
;; not have a consistent extension, you must use file local variables
;; or `auto-mode-alist' to load it automatically, for example:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
;;              '("\\`/usr/share/games/fortunes/" . fortune-mode))
 
;; The second way to use it is via the `fortune' command, which opens
;; a buffer in which you can enter one or more fortunes and then issue
;; a command which will append them to the fortune file of your
;; choice.
 
;; This simple hack allows you to write fortunes into bases.  This is
;; very simple, and the only goal was my amusement in emacs-lisp
;; programming, and having fun with friends citations.
