;; INSTALL:
;; =======

;; Of course you need w3m.
;; Put this file in your load path
;; Add to your .emacs.el:
;; (require 'w3m-meteo)
;; You can set a global key for w3m-frweather:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f7> w") 'w3m-frweather)
;; and a local key to store bookmarks:
;; (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "ma") 'w3m-meteo-bookmark-add)
;; (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "mk") 'w3m-meteo-bookmark-delete)

;; USAGE:
;; =====

;; Start with M-x `w3m-frweather' RET
;; On first start you have no bookmarks and you will be linked
;; to `w3m-meteo-initial-site', from there navigate to your favorite
;; meteo site and bookmark them with `w3m-meteo-bookmark'
;; you have now completion on your bookmarks with TAB

;; NOTE:
;; A file (see `w3m-cache-file') will be created when this file will be loaded
;; Normally you don't have to edit it manually.

;; TODO:

;; Add a function to delete bookmarks

;; Commentary:
;; A good alternative to w3m-weather for non Japonese users
