keys like ESC up (M-up) to start, up/down for speed, left-arrow to stop). 

If you do want a general 2-dimensional scrolling including horizontal
scrolling too, do an M-x toggle-truncate-lines and turn off
automatic-hscrolling in your .emacs before loading vel.el.

  " In this scroll-style, you control the velocity, not scroll-amount.
Press right mouse and see emacs scroll as long as the mouse is
pressed..  Release the mouse when done.  Alt., rightclick to enter the
scroll-phase, and right/left click when done.  Also, keys like ESC-up
and ESC-down (or M-down or M-pgdn) land you into that special
temporary vel-croll phase. Wherein the screen keeps scrolling by
itself and you control the velocity by gently moving the mouse or by
using up/down arrows or pgup/down.  Anything else gets you out of that
mode.  Type M-x vel-quick-start.

I know there are still some weird bugs in the mouse-based vel.el
scrolling, they have stopped showing up for me on my setup.  If you
encounter any, I would really like to know---that is the main
motivation for this release! :) ")

  "
There's always atmost one timer and The timer is always temporary.  

Version 0.6.1
=============
Following Doug Gerecht suggestions, introduce variables vel-ver-factor
and vel-hor-factor.  Tweak the defaults a bit. 

NEW IN VERSION 0.6
==================
Mouse-based scrolling---this is much more convenient..

No use of advices any more.

Much cleaner implementation, Smoother scroll, more customizability. 


New in v. 0.3
=============
 Following Christopher Conrad's suggestions, scrolling, by default,
 now happens as if done by hand---viz.  it calls certain pre-command-
 and post-command- hooks after scrolling.  This should enable stuff
 like highlighting to work.
 
 A revamped vel-quick-start and keybindings. 

 The preferred method of working in the minor mode vel-mode is now to
 advise next/previous-line and scroll functions. This enables turning
 on the mode globally without spoiling the arrow keys functionality in
 such modes as minibuffer-modes.  The earlier non-advice method is now
 called vel-vanilla-mode---and it is not wise to turn that minor mode
 on globally.  If you don't like the up/down arrows, please do
 complain to the author.  A few bugfixes: The timer certainly gets
 stopped now once we reach an end/beginning-of-buffer condition.
 Slightly better doc for vel-moment.

 Many thanks to Christoph Conrad and Doug Gerecht for useful
 suggestions.  Thanks to Alex Shroeder and Mario Lang on #emacs for
 help with keybindings.  Suggestions/patches welcome.
 Thanks to J&#65533;r&#65533;me.Bouat@wanadoo.fr <jerome.bouat@wanadoo.fr>@wanadoo.fr
 for suggesting fractional movements, and thanks to Kim F. Storm for
 help in accomplishing it. ")
