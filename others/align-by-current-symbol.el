;; Example usage:
;;
;; (load "align-by-current-symbol.el")
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-.") 'align-by-current-symbol)
;;
;; By default it requires spaces to be around the symbol.
;;
;; Use the following to turn this off:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-.") 
;;    (lambda () 
;;       (interactive) (align-by-current-symbol t)))
;;
;; Example demonstration:
;;
;; mumumu = zotzot
;; chi = far
;; popo = k
;; zarlo => mu
;;
;; place point at `=' after `chi', hit C-c C-.:
;;
;; mumumu = zotzot
;; chi    = far
;; popo   = k
;; zarlo => mu
