;;; Commentary:

;; Use M-x kdic to start a multiple choice practice session.  The data
;; is derived from a dictionary.  The dictionary is not included.  You
;; will have to get it yourself.  Any file in the kanjidic or edict
;; file format will do.

;; In debian, use "apt-get install kanjidic" for a large dictionary of
;; Japanese kanji including a document explaining the format of the
;; dictionary file.  Set `kdic-dictionary' and
;; `kdic-encoding'accordingly.

;; Inspired by kdrill, a drill program for kanji chars under X writte by
;; Philip Brown <phil@bolthole.com>.  The kdrill homepage can be found
;; here: http://www.bolthole.com/kdrill/.

;; Installation: Copy kdic.el into a directory on your load-path, and
;; add the following line to your ~/.emacs file:
;; (autoload 'kdic "kdic" "Practice kanji and vocabulary." t)

;; You can select subsets of the `kdic-dictionary' by customizing the
;; variables `kdic-filter' and `kdic-index-regexp'.  Here are two
;; examples of how to set it up.  First use M-x custom-group RET kdic
;; RET to customize the appropriate group, and then set the variables
;; as suggested:

;; Example 1:

;; Set kdic-index-regexp to "Jouyou grade level" and set kdic-filter
;; to "Distinct values" and choose the value "1".  This will drill you
;; on the 80 easiest kanji -- the ones having a jouyou grade level of
;; 1.

;; Example 2:

;; Set kdic-index-regexp to "Spahn & Hadamitzky index" and set
;; kdic-filter to "Grouping", using sorting function
;; "kdic-index-sort", group size 50, and group number 1.  This will
;; drill you on the first 50 kanji from the Spahn & Hadamitzky index
;; (which happens to be the book I use).

;; When you are happy with the selection, set `kdic-cache' to a
;; filename to use as a cache.  This makes parsing and filtering of
;; the original dictionary unnecessary, speeding things up when
;; starting.  Just delete the file when you want to use another
;; dictionary, or when you change the filter.

;; Advanced usage:

;; Filtering wizard: `kdic-word-filter' is a wizard that will help you
;; combine two dictionaries.  This allows you to sort the kanji in the
;; kanjidic file as described above, and then sort the entries in the
;; edict file according to the kanji with the highest number.  Thus
;; you can produce a list of words to learn that only require the
;; simplest kanji!  Example:

;; Sort the kanji in the kanjidic file according to the "Jouyou grade
;; level", and choose group number 1 of size 100.  This will sort the
;; edict files such that words with only Jouyou grade level 1 come
;; first.  From these, the first 100 words will be used.

;; Flashcard export:

;; Flashcard.el by Jorgen Schaefer offers a doctor interface instead
;; of a multiple choice test.  You can export the current vocabulary
;; into a flashcard file using `kdic-to-flashcard'.

for a list of supported dictionaries.  See `kdic-parse-entry' for the
parsing code.

If you are practicing, I recommend the KANJIDIC file.  It contains lots
of extra information for each kanji, such that you sort them by
difficulty or frequency.  See variable `kdic-filter' for more information.

If you are fluent, I recommend the EDICT file.  It has a huge word-list.
Based on KANJIDIC you can sort the words in an EDICT file by difficulty
as shown on the kdic.el homepage:

want to disable filtering.

If a list of numbers, then only entries with an index in that list will
be retained.  The index of an entry is determined using
`kdic-index-regexp'.

If you are using the Jouyou grades as an index, for example, 1 through 6
indicate Jouyou grades 1-6.  8 indicates general-use characters.  9
indicates Jinmeiyou \(\"for use in names\") characters.  If an element
in the list is nil, it will match kanjis with an index of nil.

Here's how many kanji there are on the first levels if you are using the
kanjidic file as recommended in the `kdic-dictionary' doc-string.

Level 1:  80
Level 2: 160
Level 3: 200
Level 4: 200

If a list containing a function and two numbers (FUNC SIZE NUMBER), then
FUNC will be used to sort the entries, SIZE indicates the number of
entries per group, and NUMBER indicates the group that will be used.

One possible value could therefore be '(kdic-index-sort 50 1) to use the
first 50 kanji.  Depending on `kdic-index-regexp' those will be the most
frequent, the first in the Hadamitzky book, or whatever.
