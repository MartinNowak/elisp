;;; Commentary:

;; This package create two new mode: thumbs-mode and
;; thumbs-view-image-mode. It is used for images browsing and viewing
;; from within emacs. Minimal image manipulation functions are also
;; available via external programs.
;;
;; The 'convert' program from 'ImageMagick'
;; [URL:http://www.imagemagick.org/] is required.
;;

;; CHANGELOG
;;
;; This is version 2.0
;;
;; USAGE
;;
;; Type M-x thumbs RET DIR RET to view the directory DIR in Thumbs mode.
;; That should be a directory containing image files.
;; from dired, C-t m enter in thumbs-mode with all marked files
;;             C-t a enter in thumbs-mode with all files in current-directory
;; In thumbs-mode, pressing <return> on a image will bring you in image view mode
;; for that image.  C-h m will give you a list of available keybinding.
