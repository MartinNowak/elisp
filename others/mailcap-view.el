;;; Commentary:

;; mailcap-view.el is a set of functions that allows you to do general
;; file browsing and viewing from within emacs.  The pimary function
;; is mailcap-view-file which launches a shell-command using the
;; default mime-handler.  The find-file-hooks function supplied allows
;; you to open files who's mime-type is text/* or nil in the normal
;; way.  However, files whos mime-type is defined and not text/* are
;; launched with an external viewer.  In short, hitting return in a
;; dired buffer on a .jpg will display the jpeg if you have your
;; mailcap setup properly.

;; I'm sure the style of this code isn't optimal.  Feel free to hack
;; on this and send me patches.
