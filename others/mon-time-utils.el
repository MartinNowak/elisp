;;; 
;;; TODO:
;;; Consider providing an optional arg `mon-cln-ebay-time-string'
;;; to return the stamp without the call to `mon-convert-ebay-time'
;;;
;;; NOTES:
;;; Originally motivated by a distaste for Ebay's promotion of EbayTime as
;;; `official' time - Official my ass! 
;;; :SEE (URL `http://viv.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?EbayTime')
;;;
;;; There are at least three styles of ebay timestamp. 
;;; Apparently each is 'official'... 
;;; 
;;; Clean up ebay timestrings three different ways. 
;;; * Style1 from eBay webpage i.e. copy/paste
;;; * Style2 from eBay listing manager
;;; * Style3 from eBay post listing email confirmations
;;;
;;; None of these 3(three) styles can be processed with 'parse-time-string'
;;; without some cleaning. 
;;;
;;; The function `mon-cln-ebay-time-string' returns an extended timestamp 
;;; formatted to allow further processing according to ISO 8601 spec. 
;;;
;;; The three ebay timestring styles are cleaned as follows:
;;;
;;; (Aug 07, 200913:52:24 PDT) <-style1
;;; <Timestamp: #{2009-08-07T16:52:24-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; Jul-29 11:05                 <-style2
;;; -> <Timestamp: #{2009-07-29T14:05:00-04:00Z}#{09313} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; Aug-10-09 09:16:14 PDT       <-style3
;;; -> <Timestamp: #{2009-08-06T21:17:10-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; If you don't like the default timestamp adjust 
;;; format-time-string in tail of `mon-convert-ebay-time'
;;;
;;; The form: `(put-tz (if (nth 7 (decode-time)) "PDT" "PST"))'
;;; in `mon-cln-ebay-time-string' assumes your Daylight-savings flag 
;;; is in synch with the Northern Hemisphere. 
;;; If it is Summer in Califonria and Winter where you are you may want to
;;; swap PDT <-> PST
;;;
;;; ==============================
;;; The time-stamps generated w/ functions herein have the form:
;;;
;;; <Timestamp: #{YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+/-HH:MMZ}#{yyWwD} - by NAME>
;;; <Timestamp: #{2009-08-06T21:17:10-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; This format is not in keeping with RFC-3339 take on ISO-8601 
;;; Specifically, it disregards the discussion presented in 
;;; Section 5.4. Redundant Information:
;;;
;;;   "If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
;;;    the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
;;;    For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
;;;    introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
;;;    date is correct, or vice versa.  Since it is not difficult to compute
;;;    the day of week from a date (see Appendix B), the day of week should
;;;    not be included in a date/time format."
;;;
;;; We do not share this position. While it may be true that redundancies can
;;; present errors whereby a YYYY-Www-D date calculation doesn't jibe with the
;;; YYYY-MM-DD it is incorrect to assume then that we are somehow better off
;;; omitting the Www-D data. This is bogus reasoning as it assumes that the
;;; YYYY-MM-DD date stamp is of itself somehow MORE correct than a YYYY-Www-D
;;; stamp. It is not. Rather than assume that one or another of these data will
;;; become compromised it is safer to assume either that both are potentially
;;; compromised or that both are correct. In either case provision of this
;;; 'redundancy' allows for a check against what would otherwise be
;;; uncorroborated time. Moreover, so long as the information is presented
;;; according to the standards specification it is quite legitimate to simply
;;; omit the redundancy via heuristics (regexps for example). Doing so allows us
;;; the ability to calculate multiple different types of date intervals in an
;;; adhoc 'loosey' manner whilst retaining the ability to perform more targeted
;;; calculations where necessary. This can be esp. important/useful for
;;; indicating and reasoning about time/date ranges by field as opposed by
;;; duration. E.g. "Show me all date stamps on a Tuesday." whether the date is
;;; _correct_ may be completely irrelevant to the query and it is certainly the
;;; case that the heuristics/calculations needed for locating such stamps under
;;; our regime will be quite a bit quicker and more intelligible than those
;;; which would require numerous encode->decode->calculate->encode operations
;;; just to find what may or may not be a Tuesday...

NOTE: `#{' is a reserved user dispatching macro char in CL
When optional arg TIME is non-nil, it should have a format suitable for 
processing with `format-time-string'. 
When INSERTP is non-nil or called interactively insert timestring at point.
Vanilla `format-time-string' returns 'UTC offset/ZONE' in ISO-8601 'Basic format:\n
 +/-time-hourtime-minute ->  +/- hhmm  -> \"-0500\"
The standard's grammar spec is unclear w/re time-numoffset, and Emacs'
has interpreted this as permiting mixtures of Extended/Basic format e.g.:\n
 time-numoffset    = \(\"+\" / \"-\"\) time-hour [[\":\"] time-minute]\n
where the \":\" delimiter has been deemed 'optional' to compliance and thereby
ommitted.\n
The current function extends Emacs' interpretation by colon delimiting the 
time-numoffset:
 +/-time-hour:time-minute ->  +/-hh:mm  -> \"-05:00\"\n
Additionally, the \"Zulu\" or trailing Z of ISO-8601/rfc3339 appended to the UTC.\n

Jul-29 11:05                 <-style2, from eBay listing manager
Aug-10-09 09:16:14 PDT       <-style3, from eBay post listing email confirm
replacing string with a canonically formatted timestamp.
When TIME-STRING has form of style1 following occur:
 o '(Mmm' -> Month
 o parens are removed from head and tail of string;
 o Comma after DD is removed; 
 o Whitespace is inserted after YYYY.\n
When TIME-STRING has form of style2 following occur:
 o  'Mmm-' -> Month  
 o  Current year is concatenated to string;
 o  An eBay time-zone is inserted, either PDT or PST
    This is calculated against `current-time-zone' and may return
    incorrect results if your environment's timezone doesn't track 
    daylight-savings-time in a similiar manner as the U.S. (most should).\n
When TIME-STRING has form of style3 following occur:
 o 'Mmm-' -> Month  
 o Hyphenation removed from 'Mmm-DD-YY'
 o Current year is converted from YY -> YYYY\n
For all 3\(three\) styles returns an extended timestamp formatted to allow
further processing according to ISO 8601 spec. The timestamp provides conversion of
eBay PDT or PST timezone to local time \(not everyone lives on West Coast of 
United States!\)
When optional ARG insertp is non-nil converted timestring is inserted at point.
Called intereactively processes the ebay time-string in region as per above.
Replaces existing time-string in region with converted form.\n

oStarting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the
second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the
year. The 2007 U.S. change was part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005;
previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first
Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right
to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been
done.\n
