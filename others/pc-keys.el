;;; Commentary:

;; Some useful bindings for Home and End keys: Hit the key once to go
;; to the beginning/end of a line, hit it twice in a row to go to the
;; beginning/end of the window, three times in a row goes to the
;; beiginning/end of the buffer.  NB that there is no timeout
;; involved.

First hitting key goes to beginning of line, second in a row goes to
beginning of window, third in a row goes to beginning of buffer."
