;;; school-points-off.el - A program to display grades based on number
;;;                        of problems on the test

;;; This is free software and in the public domain.
;;; Written by Terrence Brannon
;;; Version: 20041107

;;; DISCUSSION
;;; Often, in my 1-month career as a math teacher, I had to calculate a
;;; student's grade as a function of the number of problems missed. For
;;; a 20 or 10-problem test, this was easy. But sometimes by grade-making
;;; software would generate a 13-problem test and I would have to figure
;;; out how much each problem was worth. So, I wrote this to make it easier

;;; USAGE

;;  To use, put this in your .xemacs/init.el or .emacs:
;;  (autoload 'school-points-off "school-points-off"
;;     "calculate amount of points to remove per question missed" t)

;;  Then type M-x school-points-off and enter the number of problems
;;  on the test at the prompt.

(defun school-points-off (number-of-problems)

  (let ((points-per-problem (/ 100.0 number-of-problems)))
    (school-display-points-off number-of-problems points-per-problem)))

    (insert  (format "1/2 off => %.3f off\n" (/ points-per-problem 2.0)))
