;; This library defines a `one-key' menu type for accessing yasnippets.
;; See the documentation for `one-key' for how to add a new menu to a menu-set.
;; You can add a menu of type "yasnippet" which will contain snippets for the major-mode of the current buffer,
;; or a menu of type "yas:<MODE>" where <MODE> can be the name of any major-mode with snippets defined.
;; The former type of menu can be added from within the *One-Key* buffer, whereas the latter must be added
;; to a menu set from the customization buffer for `one-key-set-of-menus-alist'.
;;
 
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put one-key-yas.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add.
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'one-key-yas)

;;; Customize: 
;;
;; You may need to change the value of `yas/root-directory'
;; so that it matches the location of your snippets files.
;; This can be done by:
;;      M-x customize-variable RET yas/root-directory RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; See the git log.
