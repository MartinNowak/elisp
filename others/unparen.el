;;; Commentary:

;; `unparen-mode' toggles the display of parens.  While they are
;; hidden away, the buffer is read-only, because currently this code
;; does now really add and remove parens -- it just makes them
;; invisible.  That would be a nice feature, though.  At the moment,
;; this minor mode is mainly useful to show lisp code to non-lisp
;; coders affraid of parens.

;;; Code:

(define-minor-mode unparen-mode
  "Make all parens invisible, unless they are quoted."
  nil "()"  nil
  (if unparen-mode
      (unparen)
    (unparen-disable)))

(defun unparen ()
  "Hide all parens and make buffer read-only."
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (re-search-forward "[()]" nil t)
    (if (and (eq ?' (char-before (match-beginning 0)))
	     (eq ?\( (char-after (match-beginning 0))))
	(progn
	  (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
	  (forward-sexp))
      (put-text-property (match-beginning 0)
			 (match-end 0)
			 'invisible
			 'unparen)))
  (toggle-read-only 1))

(defun unparen-disable ()
  "Make all parens visible and buffer editable."
  (toggle-read-only -1)
  (remove-text-properties (point-min)
			  (point-max)
			  '(invisible nil)))

(provide 'unparen)
