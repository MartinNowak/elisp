;;; Commentary:

;; This spot of code extends M-x checkdoc to check that Keywords: contains
;; at least one keyword known to `finder-by-keywords'.  See the docstring of
;; `checkdoc-keywords-comment' below for more.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and up, works in XEmacs 21 and Emacs 20.

;;; Install:

;; Put checkdoc-keywords.el in one of your `load-path' directories
;; and in your .emacs add
;;
;;     (autoload 'checkdoc-keywords-comment "checkdoc-keywords")
;;     (add-hook 'checkdoc-comment-style-hooks 'checkdoc-keywords-comment)
;;
;; There's an autoload cookie on the function if you know how to use
;; `update-file-autoloads' and friends, after which add or customize the
;; hook.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - don't insert an empty keyword
;; Version 3 - some help for completing-help.el
;; Version 4 - return nil so as not to short-circuit the hook
;; Version 5 - undo completing-help.el setups on unload-feature
;; Version 6 - emacs21 completing-read requires strings in the table
;;           - don't double comma if existing Keywords ends in comma

(defun checkdoc-keywords-comment ()
  "Check for at least one known \"Keyword:\" value.
This function is designed for use in `checkdoc-comment-style-hooks'.

It checks the file has a Keywords header line like

    ;; Keywords: foo, bar

and that at least one keyword is in `finder-known-keywords' so
that the file can appear under `finder-by-keyword'.  Extra
private keywords are fine, as long as there's at least one
standard one.

If there's no known keyword or no Keywords header at all then
you're prompted to choose one to insert.

`lm-keywords-finder-p' is used to check for a known keyword.
Files meant only as a sub-component of another Lisp file probably
shouldn't appear under `finder-by-keyword' and so won't have a
known keyword, but currently there's no way to flag that (perhaps
`lm-keywords-finder-p' could get something).  For now just answer
\"n\" to the query.
