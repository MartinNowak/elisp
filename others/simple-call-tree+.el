;;;; Introduction:
;; This library is based on simple-call-tree.el by Alex Schroeder, but you
;; do not need that library to use it (this is a replacement).
;; It displays a buffer containing a call tree for functions in source
;; code files. You can easily & quickly navigate the call tree, displaying
;; the code in another window, and apply query-replace or other commands
;; to individual functions.

;; When the command `simple-call-tree-display-buffer' is executed
;; a call tree for the functions in the current buffer will be created.
;; The user is also prompted for other files to include in the call tree.
;; The call tree is displayed in a buffer called *Simple Call Tree*,
;; which has a dedicated menu in the menu-bar showing various commands
;; and their keybindings. Most of these commands are self explanatory
;; so try them out.

;;;; Navigation:
;; You can navigate the call tree either by moving through consecutive
;; headers (n/p or N/P keys) or by jumping to main branches (j for branch
;; corresponding to function at point, and J to prompt for a function).
;; When you jump to a branch, it is added to `simple-call-tree-jump-ring',
;; and you can navigate your jump history using the </> keys.
;; You can also add the function under point to the jump-ring with the . key.
;; If you use a negative prefix (e.g. C--) before pressing j then the branch
;; jumped to will not be added to the jump-ring.
;; If you have fm.el (available here: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/fm.el)
;; you can press f to toggle follow mode on/off.

;;;; Display
;; Normally child branches correspond to functions/variables called by the parent
;; branch. However, if you invert the tree by pressing i then the child branches
;; will correspond to functions that call the parent branch.
;; You can sort the tree in various different ways, and change the depth of the tree.
;; You can also narrow the tree to the function at point by pressing /

;;;; Exporting:
;; The tree can be exported in its current state with the `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'
;; command, and you can alter the TODO state and types of links using options `simple-call-tree-org-todo-state',
;; and `simple-call-tree-org-link-style'. This may be useful for project management.

;;;; Refactoring
;; You can perform `query-replace' or `query-replace-regexp' on the function at
;; point by pressing % or C-%, or any other arbitrary command by pressing !
;; This may be useful when refactoring.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put simple-call-tree+.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'simple-call-tree+)
;;
;; You might also want to define a key for creating the call tree, 
;; e.g. like this:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c S") 'simple-call-tree-display-buffer)


;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `simple-call-tree-default-recenter'
;;    How to recenter the window after moving to another function in the "*Simple Call Tree*" buffer.
;;  `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts'
;;    List of fonts to use for finding objects to include in the call tree.
;;  `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts'
;;    List of fonts that should not be in the text property of any valid token.
;;  `simple-call-tree-default-sort-method'
;;    The default sort method to use when a call tree is newly created.
;;  `simple-call-tree-default-maxdepth'
;;    The depth at which new call trees should be displayed.
;;  `simple-call-tree-major-mode-alist'
;;    Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
;;  `simple-call-tree-org-link-style'
;;    Style used for links of child headers when exporting org tree using `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'.
;;  `simple-call-tree-org-todo-state'
;;    TODO state to add to toplevel headers when exporting org tree using `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'.
;;  `simple-call-tree-jump-ring-max'
;;    Maximum number of elements in `simple-call-tree-jump-ring', before old elements are removed.

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET simple-call-tree+ RET
;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; If anyone wants to implement the following ideas, please do:
;; More reliable code for building tree (handle duplicate function names properly).
;; Fix code so that we can have several calls to the same function in the same tree.
;; Code for marking functions (like with files in dired mode) and then applying operations to the marked functions.
;; Code for rearranging functions.
;; Code for renaming functions.

  "Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
Each element is a list in the form '(MAJOR-MODE VALID-FONTS INVALID-FONTS START-TEST END-TEST) where:

MAJOR-MODE is the symbol for the major-mode that this items applies to.

VALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts for finding objects for the call tree (functions/variables/etc).
If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts' will be used.

INVALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts that should not be present in the text properties of
any objects to be added to the call tree. If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts' will be used.
The invalid fonts will also be checked when finding function calls.

START-TEST indicates how to determing the start of the next object. Potential objects are found by checking
the fonts of tokens in the buffer (against VALID-FONTS). If START-TEST is a function then it will be used as
an additional check for potential objects. It will be passed the buffer position of the beginning of the
current token to check, and should return non-nil if it represents a valid object.

NEXT-FUNC is an alternative way of determining the locations of functions.
It is either nil, meaning the function locations will be determined by fonts and maybe START-TEST,
or a function of no args which moves point to the start of the next function in the buffer.

END-FUNC indicates how to find the end of the current object when parsing a buffer for the call tree.
It is either nil, meaning that font changes will be used to determine the end of an object,
or a function of no args which moves point to the end of the current function in the buffer.

START-REGEXP a regular expression to match the beginning of a token, you can probably leave this blank.
By default it is \"\\_<\".

END-REGEXP a regular expression to match the end of a token, by default this is \"\\_>\"."
