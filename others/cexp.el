;;; Commentary:

;; Poorman's implementation of combined expressions.
;; Combined expressions are combinations of regular expressions and balanced expressions.
;; You can use search-forward-cexp for searching combined expressions.
;; Some clumsy way of storing the match-data and the balanced expressions is provided.
;; That is just a test implementation.
;; Example:
;; (setq var-match-data (search-forward-cexp "foo\\!(\\`(\\([[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]*\\)\\(,[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]*\\)*)\\'\\!)"))
;; This combined expression matches the following string:
;; foo(x,y34,zoo)
;; Investigate the match data:
;; (set-match-data var-match-data)
;; For an example get the function name:
;; (match-string-no-properties 0)
;; And get the balanced expression inclusive the delimiters which are assured to be `(' and `)' in this example:
;; (match-string-no-properties 1)
