(define-minor-mode smart-spacing-mode
  "Smart spacing: word-wise kill&yank.
When this mode is enabled, kill and yank operations support
word-wise editing.  Afer killing (copying) a word or several
words, the text will be inserted as a full phrase when
yanking. That means that spaces around the word may be inserted
during yanking, and spaces and other word delimiters are removed
during killing as necessary to leave only one space between
words.

During killing, smart-spacing-mode behaves conservatively.  It
will never delete more than one extra space at a time.

This feature is part of Aquamacs."
