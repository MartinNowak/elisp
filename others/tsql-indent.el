;;; Commentary:

;; tsql-indent indents SQL statements and was specifically written to
;; indent Microsoft Transact SQL code.  Indentation of the current
;; line is based upon indentation of previous lines and looking
;; backward through the code for indentation hints.

;; Lines will be indented to the same indentation level of the
;; previous line unless the previous line is a begin, is part of a
;; select statement, or the current line is an end statement.  If the
;; previous line is a begin statement, the current line will be
;; indented to the right compared to the begin statement.  If the
;; previous line is part of a select statement, the select statement
;; is indented so that all portions of the select statement line up to
;; the same tab stop.  If the current line is an end statement, then
;; it will be outdented compared to the previous line.

;; Code inspection is performed via one of several regular
;; expressions.  These regular expressions are defined in
;; customization variables.

;; Installation

;; This library should be loaded once SQL mode has finished loading.
;; One way to accomplish this is to add the following to your .emacs
;; file:

;; (eval-after-load "sql"
;;   '(load-library "tsql-indent"))

;; Once the library is loaded, all SQL mode buffers from that point
;; forward will use this indentation function.

;; Inspiration

;; The inspiration for this code came from "sql-indent" by Alex
;; Schroeder (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SqlIndent).
;; Also, an excellent tutorial on indenation in "An Emacs language
;; mode creation tutorial"
;; (http://two-wugs.net/emacs/mode-tutorial.html).
