;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; What is here:

;; This file contains a couple of functions to make emacs treat `&'s
;; more like cell separators in e.g. excell. This makes sense if you
;; are using the tabular environment in LaTeX all the time. Maybe
;; other times as well.

;; There are two core functions: tab-in-tabular and
;; backtab-in-tabular, the first of which tries first to find a
;; logical next ampersand to jump to, and if there isn't one it checks
;; if there is an amp on the previous line that it can align a new one
;; with. The next paragraph gives the algorithm in excruciating
;; detail, feel free to ignore it.


;; tab-in-tabular checks if there is an ampersand to the right of
;; point on the current line, if there is it moves point to the right
;; of it. If there is not, it checks if there is an ampersand to the
;; right of point on the immediately previous line, if *that* exists
;; an amp is created directly beneath it, and point is moved to the
;; right of it. Third option, if the first two failed, it checks if
;; there is a `\\' to the right of point on the current line, and if
;; there is it checks if there is an amp on the next line, which if
;; there is it moves point a little to the left of it. (That's sort of
;; a bug, see bugs) If there are no appropriate ampersands, it does
;; the normal tab-thing

;; backtab-in-tabular just checks if there is an amp before point on
;; this line or the immediately preceding line and moves point to the
;; left of the word inside the field, sort of.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; What is not here (bugs):

;; re-search-backward, or match-beginning/end doesn't do what i want,
;; so i can't seem to make point go to the left of a word.

;; Basically, the leftmost column doesn't do exactly what i want,
;; because of that bug.

;; It's kind of ugly that i search for a (nearly) impossible string
;; instead of just returning nil at the end of my utility
;; functions. Can't find a function to return nil, though. Help/advice
;; welcome.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Installation:

;; stick this file in your load-path.

;; Then, stick something like the following in your .emacs file:

;; (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'latex-redefine-tab)
;; (defun latex-redefine-tab ()
;;   "just calls `define-key' and sets tab up to use my function"
;;   (load "tab-in-tabular")
;;   (define-key LaTeX-mode-map "\t\ " 'tab-in-tabular)
;;   (define-key LaTeX-mode-map [S-iso-lefttab] 'backtab-in-tabular)
;;   (define-key LaTeX-mode-map [C-tab] 'indent-for-tab-command))

;; That [S-iso-lefttab] is maybe/probably wrong for your keyboard, to
;; find out what the correct thing is type `S-<TAB> M-x view-lossage
;; <RET>' and you'll see what your computer does for backtab. Just
;; replace the angle brackets with square brackets and put it in the
;; second define-key line.
