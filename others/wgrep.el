;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep provides to edit grep buffer and to apply the changes to
;; the file buffer.

;;; Install:

;; Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (require 'wgrep)

;;; Usage:

;; You can edit the text on *grep* buffer after type C-c C-p.
;; After that the changed text is highlighted.
;; Following keybind is defined.

;; C-c C-e : Apply the highlighting changes to file buffers.
;; C-c C-u : All changes are unmarked and ignored.
;; C-c C-r : Remove the highlight in the region (The Changes doesn't
;;      apply to files. Of course, if you type C-c C-e, the remained
;;      highlight changes are applied to files.)
;; C-c C-p Toggle read-only area.
;; C-c C-k Discard all changes and exit.
;; C-x C-q Exit wgrep mode.

;; To avoid slowing down grep process, turn off the filter by
;;   M-x wgrep-disable-filter

;; To save all buffers that wgrep changed by
;;   M-x wgrep-save-all-buffers

;;; History:

;; This program is forked version. Original version can be downloaded from
;; http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/grep-edit.el

;; Following added implementations and differences.
;; * Support GNU grep context option -A -B and -C
;; * Some bugfix. (wrong coloring text etc..)
;; * wdired.el like interface.
;; * Remove all advice.
;; * Bind to local variables. (grep-a-lot.el works well)
;; * After save buffer, colored face will be removed.
;; * Change face easy to see.

;;; TODO:

;; * can remove whole line. (In file buffer)
