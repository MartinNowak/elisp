;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a number of wizards to help you create
;; flashcard decks based on a number of existing dictionaries.
;; currently supported are all dictionaries in the KANJIDIC and EDICT
;; format, ie. KANJIDIC, EDICT, ENUMDIC, JDDICT, COMPDIC.

;; Use `flashmaker-kanjidic-filter' to create a new flashcard deck
;; based on a KANJIDIC format file.

;; Use `flashmaker-edict-filter' to create a new flashcard deck based
;; on a KANJIDIC format file, and an EDICT format file.  The KANJIDIC
;; file will be used to classify all characters, and then the
;; expressions in the EDICT file will be filtered according to this
;; classification, thus producing a subset of the EDICT File limited
;; to the kanji you want to practice.

;; When reading the files, the encoding can be problematic.  If your
;; Emacs does not recognize EUC-JP automatically, I recommend the
;; following addition to your init file:

;; (add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '("edict\\'" . euc-jp))
;; (add-to-list 'auto-coding-alist '("kanjidic\\'" . euc-jp))

;; When saving the files, I recommend the coding system iso-2022-jp.

;; In debian, use "apt-get install kanjidic" for a large dictionary of
;; Japanese kanji including a document explaining the format of the
;; dictionary file.

;; You can use flashcard decks to practice using flashcard.el by
;; Jorgen Schaefer.

;;; TODO:

;; Add support for XML based dictionaries.

;;; History:

;; This code is based on the parsing code of kdic.el 1.7.1.
