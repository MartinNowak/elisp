   Create an extractor. Field is a string identifying the data extracted.

   BOUNDS-FN takes two parameters: START END bounding a region to search.
   It returns a three element list consisting of START END, and any extracted
   data as the final value.

   EXTRACTORS is a list of sub-extractors. They will be executed within the
   bounds established by BOUNDS-FN allowing extractors to be nested.
