;;; Commentary:

;; This library integrates babel (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/babel.el) with ERC 
;; (an emacs IRC client: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ERC) to provide automatic
;; translation of messages. It requires those two libraries are installed.
;; All sent and received messages will be translated if possible.
;; Different languages combinations can be set for different buffers, and translation can be toggled on or off.

;; It has only been tested on emacs 23.1.50.1 (CVS emacs), with ERC version 5.3.

;; To toggle translation on/off (it is off by default) call `erc-babel-toggle'.

;; To set the languages to translate from and to for a particular buffer, call `erc-babel-set-languages'
;; The language combinations can be different for different buffers/channels.
;; To remember them between emacs sessions you could use session.el by Christopher Wedler 
;; (available here: http://emacs-session.sourceforge.net/), and add `erc-babel-alist' to session-globals-include.
;; To remove translation for a particular buffer, set the from and to languages to the same value.

;; To include the original text with the translated message make sure `erc-babel-include-orig' is non-nil
;; This can be turned on/off by calling `erc-babel-include-orig-toggle'.

;; You can choose which webservice to use for doing the actual translation by customizing `erc-babel-backend' to
;; one of those listed. By default it uses Google, but you can change it if that doesn't work for you (check you 
;; have the latest version of babel.el)

;; You can also change the modeline display by customizing `erc-babel-modeline-type'. 
;; It shows you the languages being translated, and in which direction(s). 
;; By default it uses the full language names but you can change it to use short abbreviations.

;; As usual to use this library just put to following somewhere in your .emacs:

;; (require 'erc-babel)

;; it requires the babel and erc libraries.

;; You may also want to bind some keys in erc-mode like this:

;; (define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-S-t") 'erc-babel-toggle)
;; (define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-S-o") 'erc-babel-include-orig-toggle)

;; which can be put somewhere in your .emacs
