;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; Designed for use with Keychain (see:
;; http://docs.funtoo.org/wiki/Keychain) a tool for loading the SSH
;; Agent and keeping it running and accessible on a machine for longer
;; than a single login seession.
;; 
;; This library loads the file "$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh" and parses it for
;; the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AUTH_PID variables.

;; It also checks "$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg" for the
;; GPG_AGENT_INFO variable, placing these into the environment of
;; Emacs.  If these files are empty, or the variables can't be parsed
;; out of them it doesn't replace existing environment variables.
;;
;; This is useful for situations where you are running Emacs under X, not
;; directly from a terminal, and its inheriting its environment from the
;; window manager, which doesn't have these variables as you started keychain
;; after you logged in (say as part of your .bashrc)
;;
;; The function (keychain-refresh-environment) can also be run at any time
;; these variables change.

;;; Installation:
;; Put the file in your load-path then use:
;; 
;;   (require 'keychain-environment)
;;   (keychain-refresh-environment)
;;
;; If you want to customise the location of the keychain file then use:
;;
;;   M-x customize-group
;;   keychain

;;; History:
;; 2008-12-18 Initial development.
;; 2009-02-25 Fixed bug with system-name being evaluated to the full hostname
;; 2010-07-27 Added GPG_AGENT support
;;            (by Michael Markert: markert dot michael at googlemail dot com)
;; 2011-08-10 Rolled several patches together
