(defmacro tagbody (&rest expressions)
  "Evaluate EXPRESSIONS and return nil, allowing tags and `go's.
Any bare \(unquoted) symbols and integers in EXPRESSIONS are not
evaluated and instead define tags which can be the target of `go'
expressions, which can appear anywhere in the `tagbody' and cause
control to be transfered to the statement immediately following the
corresponding tag.

It is very rare that you would want to use `tagbody', since it is
essentially a goto statement, something conspicuously absent from
Lisp.  In Common Lisp, `tagbody' is mainly used to define other
control expressions, most of which are already provided by Emacs Lisp
or the CL package."
  ;; We implement `tagbody' by splitting EXPRESSIONS at each tag,
  ;; making the resulting tagless blocks of code into a list of lambda
  ;; functions which are normally executed sequentially.  To `go' to a
  ;; tag, we look up the tag in `taglist' to find the associated block
  ;; and restart execution at that point.  In order to stop execution
  ;; when a `go' is encountered, we use `catch' and `throw'.
