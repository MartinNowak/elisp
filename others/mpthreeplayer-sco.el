;; * How to use scoring in mp3player
;;
;; When you load mp3player, you are set to a default mood
;; 'mp3player-default-mood' A mood is a one word string describing how
;; you feel (like "funny", "tired", "aggresive"...)  Each mood have is
;; own set of scoring rules.
;;
;; You can change your mood with M-x mp3player-change-mood.
;;
;; Every music file start with a default score of 0 the command
;; mp3player-score-up-current and mp3player-score-down-current modify the
;; score of the file you are curently listening by 1 In addition,
;; skipping a file (with mp3player-skip) automaticaly score the file
;; down.
;;
;; With scoring on (this mean the variable mp3player-use-scoring is t),
;; mp3player will compare the score of the file with your tolerance to
;; decide if it is played or not.
;;
;; The default tolerance level is 0 (or the variable
;; mp3player-min-score).  This mean files with a score of 0 or more will
;; be played and files with a score of -1 or less will be skipped.
;;
;; You can change the tolerance (by 1) with M-x
;; mp3player-score-lower-tolerance and M-x
;; mp3player-score-be-more-tolerant
;;
;; History:
;;
;; Initial version of this file was 1.8.  
;; A experimental buggy version! 
;;
;; 1.9: Fix in the scores-file format.
