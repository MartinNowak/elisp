;;; Commentary:

;; Hey there.

;; The Emacs Wiki (http://www.emacswiki.org/) is just about the
;; coolest thing ever.

;; Here's some code to help you keep up with all of the Elisp in
;; the Emacs Wiki's Elisp area, which lives here:
;;		 http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/

;; Basically, the idea is that you make a directory in which you
;; keep elisp files from the emacs wiki. This is
;; "~/elisp/from-the-emacs-wiki/" by default. You add this to your
;; `load-path'.

;; Assuming this file is also in your `load-path' somewhere, you
;; want to (require 'wikiarea) in your ~/.emacs or some such. Now,
;; M-x wikiarea RET should pull up a *WikiArea* buffer in which a
;; list of files should appear. Hitting RET on a new or updated
;; file will download it to your `wikiarea-managed-directory',
;; while hitting RET on an up-to-date file will visit it (if it
;; exists). C-u RET will always download a new copy of the file.

;; You might want to seed your `wikiarea-managed-directory' by
;; grabbing the Elisp area tarball from:
;;	      http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp.tar.gz

;; The code uses a cache of the last file info from the website
;; instead of looking at your files' modification times. It should
;; probably do the latter. It also relies on Alex's current HTML
;; formatting, as well as his most excellent `http-get.el', also
;; available in the wiki's lisp area. Thanks to Tom Pierce
;; <tom@pierceport.com> for the patch adding `http-get.el' support
;; & other enhancements.
