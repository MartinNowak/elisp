;;; Documentation:

;; This package is used to edit files produced by diff -u or
;; equivalent CVS diff.  You can use it to review your patch after you
;; have created it, to remove unwanted portions, to regenerate other
;; portions, reverse them, etc.  Only `unified' format patches are
;; supported.

;; To install this package, add the following to your .emacs:

;; (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.diff$" . diff-mode))
;;   auto-mode-alist))

;; and make sure to load this source file.  To have it auto-loaded any
;; time diff-mode is requested:

;; (autoload 'diff-mode "~/path/to/diff.el" nil t)

;; To use this package more conveniently you may need to set some
;; key bindings in your .emacs:

;; (defun my-diff-mode-patch ()
;;   (local-set-key [(super g)] 'diff-update-current-file)
;;   (local-set-key [(super f)] 'diff-find-new-file)
;;   (local-set-key [(super h)] 'diff-hide-body)
;;   (local-set-key [(super s)] 'diff-show-body)
;;   (local-set-key [(super n)] 'diff-forward-file)
;;   (local-set-key [(super p)] 'diff-backward-file)
;;   (local-set-key [(super r)] 'diff-reverse-current-file))
;; (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook 'my-diff-mode-patch)

;; I have made this package to help me to clean up, check my
;; patches, and to update them incrementally as i review my changes or
;; introduce new ones.
;; This package has no direct relation with the `ediff' library.

;; In the documentation, the word 'file' is used ambiguously,
;; referring sometimes to the actual patch file or to the individual
;; file-relative portions in the patch.

;;; History:
;; * 3 Dec 2001: minor documentation clean-ups.
;; * 2 Dec 2001: added documentation, first public release (on the Emacs
;; Wiki).
