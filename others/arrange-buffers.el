;;; Commentary:
;;
;; (arrange-buffers MATCH-NAME MATCH-MODE)
;; Displays all buffers whose name regexp-match MATCH-NAME
;;                *and* whose mode regexp-match MATCH-MODE.
;;
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this file in your load path and
;; (require 'arrange-buffers)
;;
;;
;;; Examples:
;;
;; Show all open buffers in (any) lisp mode
;; (arrange-buffers ".*" "lisp")
;;
;; Show all open org-buffers
;; (arrange-buffers ".*" "org-mode")
;;
;; Show all open rcirc channels:
;; (arrange-buffers "^#" "rcirc-mode")
;; Show all open rcirc queries:
;; (arrange-buffers "^[^#&\\*]" "rcirc-mode")
;;
