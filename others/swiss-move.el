;;; Commentary:
;; - Moving one line at a time is slow, but precise.
;; - Moving in screenfulls (aka scrolling) ist not fast enough for
;;   large buffers and is not precise.
;; Thus you ususally scroll to another part of your large file and
;; then use the one-line-movement for exact adjustment.
;;
;; This can be improved if subsequent keystrokes would reduce the
;; amount of lines scrolled.  Please see the docstring of
;; `swiss-move-line' for examples that try to explain it.
;; You'd probably best try it out now.
;;
;; Actually the term "Swiss Movement" is introduced here and it stems
;; from the *li-variable names that occur in these functions ;-)
;;
;; Installation:
;; ------------
;; Put
;; (require 'swiss-move)
;; somewhere in you init files and add the keybinding, e.g.:
;; (global-set-key '[(shift prior)]           'swiss-move-line-up)
;; (global-set-key '[(shift next)]            'swiss-move-line-down)

Subsequent jumps will be smaller.  This works for
changing directions, too.  Thus you can close in on to your target.

You might also consider the guessing a random number between 0 and
100. From you initial position 0 you jump forward half the distance to
50.  Then your quiz-master tells you that the random number is larger.
You take another jump forward, using half the last stepsize to 75.
This time your guess is too high, so take a step back, again taking
half of the last stepsize to 63.  And so on.

You'd better test it.
