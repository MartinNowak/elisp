;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is for making documentation from Elisp doc strings. It is
;; intended as an alternative to using info.
;;
;; Right now, the only output format is creole-wiki. But that could
;; change.

;;; Source code
;;
;; The wikidoc source code is not in a public repo yet.

;;; Style note
;;
;; This codes uses the emacs style of:
;;
;;    wikidoc---private-function 
;;
;; for private functions.
;;
;;; Examples
;; 
;; This is the main paragraph converter:
;;
;; (wikidoc--convert "this is a function.
;;  this is an example
;;  this should 'not' be changed to a link
;; This is the main text. It can include references to other 'functions'.
;; When there are 'two' references 'on the same line' it should
;; still work.")
