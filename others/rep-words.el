;;; Commentary:

;; This quick little hack searches from point forward for words that
;; repeat too many times within a short space of text--a common
;; problem (or phenomenon, at any rate) in fiction or other writing.
;; Once found, said words are highlighted and you have the option to
;; recursively edit them or skip them.  This is part of a larger
;; project i am working on--called `litmus'--for working with
;; literary manuscripts.  I wrote this to use with my own novel
;; manuscript because i couldn't find such a thing ready-made.  I
;; found it useful, so here it is.

;; The entry point is the function `rep-words'.

;; To use, do M-x rep-words RET.  With a prefix argument `rep-words'
;; will prompt for how large an area of text should be searched
;; surrounding the current word.  If you say `100' then you will be
;; shown words that have too many repeats within 50 words one way or
;; the other; then it will prompt for the number of repeats that in
;; your view constitutes `too many'.  So you might do:

;; C-u M-x rep-words RET 200 RET 3 RET -- to search for any word
;; that is repeated more than 3 (4 or more) times in any 200 word
;; stretch.

;; Without a prefix argument `rep-words' will use the values of
;; `rep-max-repeats' (default: 2) and `rep-region-size' (default:
;; 100).

;; Each time a match is found all occurrences of it in the buffer
;; will be highlighted and you will be given the option to skip it,
;; quit entirely (leaving point where it is) or recursively edit.
;; If you choose to edit, the usual C-M-c will take you back to the
;; search, but starting at the CURRENT location of point, not where
;; it was when you entered the edit.

;; Finally, since some words are so common that they will constantly
;; make matches you don't care about, the variable `rep-ignore-list'
;; contains a list of strings--words you want the function to
;; ignore.  I seed it below with a few of the more obvious English
;; words.  Change it to anything you want.

;;; Requirements:

;; Uses hi-lock.el.  I think that's an Emacs 22 thing.  Maybe works
;; with earlier versions.

;;; Bugs:

;; Standard disclaimer: i'm not a real programmer, etc.  The word
;; matching regexp could be improved?--the whole approach could be
;; improved?  Who knows.  Also, no Emacs lisp library should have
;; more comments than code, as this one does.

;;; History:

;; Basic testing on Emacs 22 and 23.
