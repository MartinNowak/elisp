;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sometimes I use multiwindow to do my job, and when i switch to other
;; buffer and go back, the original layout is gone. I have to set it up
;; again.
;; I was very annoyed about this so I tried other packages to help me
;; out. I found `WinnerMode', which did something I didn't want, and 
;; `TaskMode', which is too powerful to be used simply.(just reading its
;; manual made me dizzy) So I wrote this by myself.
;; Actually this is my first emacs extention package and I don't really
;; know if I have done it well. But I think this package is already quite
;; useable.
;; 
;; To start using this package, add following to your emacs startup file.
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
;; (require 'layoutrestore)
;; ;; save layout key
;; (global-set-key [?\C-c ?l] 'layout-save-current)
;; ;; load layout key
;; (global-set-key [?\C-c ?\C-l ?\C-l] 'layout-restore)
;; ;; cancel(delete) layout key
;; (global-set-key [?\C-c ?\C-l ?\C-c] 'layout-delete-current)
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Change the keybindings to whatever you like.
;;
;; `layout-save-current' save the current window layout so that when next
;; time you switch back to this buffer ,the layout will be brought back
;; automatically. You can also manually use `layout-restore' to restore
;; the layout.
;; When you feel a layout is useless, switch to the buffer where saved it
;; and use `layout-delete-current' to delete this layout.
;;
;; These codes are simple and well documented. you can easily hack it by
;; youself.
;;
;; Any question, or advice, please mail to XYZvektorXYZ@XYZyeahXYZ.net .
;; (remove all XYZ from above email address to get the real one.)
