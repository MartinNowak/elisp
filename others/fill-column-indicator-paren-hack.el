;;; Commentary:

;; Many modern editors and IDEs can graphically indicate the location of the
;; fill column, either by shading the area to the right of the fill column or
;; by drawing a thin line (in design parlance, a `rule') down the length of
;; the editing window.  Fill-column-indicator implements both of these
;; facilities in Emacs. 

;; Installation
;; ============

;; Put this file in your load path and put 
;; 
;;   (require 'fill-column-indicator)
;;
;; in your .emacs.  

;; Usage
;; =====

;; To toggle graphical indication of the fill column in a buffer, use the
;; command `fci-mode'.

;; Fill-column-indicator has two modes of operation:

;; o In shading mode, it shades the portion of the window to the right of the
;;   fill column.  This is the default.

;; o In rule mode, it draws a thin line at the fill column.

;; The mode of operation is controlled by the variable `fci-style'; the
;; recognized values are 'shading and 'rule.  If you'd like fci-mode to use a
;; rule by default, put
;;
;;   (setq fci-style 'rule) 
;;
;; in your .emacs.  (Buffer-local values of fci-style are supported.)

;; Configuration:  Shading Style
;; =============================

;; The appearance of the shading is controlled by the face `fci-shading'; its
;; attributes can be set like those of any face.

;; Configuration:  Rule Style
;; ==========================

;; On window systems the rule is drawn using an image generated by fci-mode;
;; the rule's width (in pixels) is determined by the variable
;; `fci-rule-width'.  On character terminals the rule is drawn using the
;; character specified by `fci-rule-character'.  In both cases the color is
;; controlled by `fci-rule-color'.  If you'd like the rule to be drawn using
;; fci-rule-character even on graphical displays, set
;; `fci-always-use-textual-rule' to a non-nil value.

;; The image formats used by fci-mode are XPM, PBM, and XBM.  By default, it
;; tries to use use them in that order.  You can specify a particular format
;; by setting `fci-rule-image-format' to either 'xpm, 'xpm, or 'xbm.

;; Other Options
;; =============

;; When `truncate-lines' is nil, the effect of drawing a fill-column
;; indicator is very odd looking (think about what it means to talk about
;; "the" location of the fill column in a window with continuation
;; lines).  For this reason, fci-mode sets truncate-lines to t in buffers in
;; which it is enabled and restores it to its previous value when
;; disabled.  You can turn off this feature by setting
;; `fci-handle-truncate-lines' to nil.

;; If `line-move-visual' is t, then vertical navigation can behave oddly in
;; one or two edge cases while fci-mode is enabled (this is due to a bug in C
;; code).  By default fci-mode locally sets line-move-visual to nil when
;; enabled and restores it when disabled.  This can be suppressed by setting
;; `fci-handle-line-move-visual' to nil.  (But you shouldn't want to do this.
;; There's no reason to use line-move-visual if truncate-lines is t, and it
;; doesn't make sense to use something like fci-mode when truncate-lines is
;; nil.)

;; Troubleshooting
;; ===============

;; o If the fill-column indication is misaligned on some lines but otherwise
;;   looks normal, then you're most likely not displaying the buffer contents
;;   with a monospaced font.  Check whether one of the lines in question has
;;   a non-ascii character that's wider or shorter than the normal character
;;   width.  Also, be aware that certain font-lock themes set some faces so
;;   that they look monospaced but aren't quite so.

;; o If the rule appears as a dashed (rather than uninterrupted) line on
;;   window systems, try changing the image format. (See the above section on
;;   configuring the rule style indicator.)

;; o If the terminal type does not support at least inverse video, then
;;   shading is impossible, and you should set fci-style to 'rule.

;; o Although the XBM format is natively supported by Emacs, the
;;   implementation on some ports is incomplete; the v23 and v24 Mac OS X
;;   ports are examples.  On these systems XBM images are always drawn in the
;;   foreground color of the frame's default face, in which case one cannot
;;   control the color of the rule.  Use XPM or PBM images instead.

;; Known Issues
;; ============

;; o The indicator extends only to end of the buffer contents (as opposed to
;;   running the full length of the editing window).

;; o If the buffer contents do not end in a newline, then the indicator
;;   extends only to the penultimate line.

;; o When using shading style on a character terminal, lines that fall one
;;   character short of the window border show the frame background color in
;;   the last column instead of shading.  This appears to be an artifact of
;;   the mechanism that displays truncation and line continuation glyphs; a
;;   fix will probably require patching the C code.

;; Todo
;; ====

;; o Play well with outline minor mode and other forms of folding
;;   (nxml-outln, etc.).
