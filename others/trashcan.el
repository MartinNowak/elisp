;; NOTE: this file contains a slight alteration to the `trashcan--is-a-windows-system'
;; function from the original. I couldn't find the contact details for the original author
;; (the weblink is dead), but I'm posting to emacswiki anyway for the benefit of others.
;; Joe Bloggs (<vapniks@yahoo.com>).
;; I have also altered the defadvice for delete-file and delete-directory to handle the case
;; where the home directory is in a different partition.

;;; Commentary:

;; The file trashcan.el contains a recoverable file deletion system
;; that behaves like the trash can or recycle bin that many operating
;; systems, present and past, show on their screens. This system
;; creates special directories known as trashcan directories to hold
;; files that can be deleted (permanently) or undeleted (restored /
;; recovered). On Unix systems there is one trashcan directory for
;; each user and the default values are $HOME/.TRASHCAN for each value
;; of $HOME. On Windows systems there are trashcan directories at the
;; following default locations: a:\TRASHCAN, b:\TRASHCAN, c:\TRASHCAN
;; etc.

;; This system changes the behaviour of the "x" key in dired mode from
;; permanently deleting files to a two stage system. If you are not in
;; a trashcan directory, then the selected files are moved into a
;; trashcan directory. If you are already in a trashcan directory, the
;; the selected files are permanently deleted. Files in a trashcan
;; directory can be restored by viewing that directory in dired mode,
;; selecting some files and executing the command M-x
;; trashcan-restore. All of the files in a trashcan directory can also
;; be permanently deleted in one hit by issuing the command M-x
;; trashcan-empty. The name "trashcan" comes from my old Amiga
;; Computer which I still have fond memories of!

;;; Install Instructions:

;; Drag the mouse over the text of this document, taking care not to
;; select the navigation menus at the top and bottom of this page.
;; Load an empty file trashcan.el into Emacs and paste the contents
;; into that buffer, then save it.  To use, put this file somewhere
;; in load-path and load it by putting the following command
;; in your .emacs file:

;; (require 'trashcan)

;;; More Info:

;; See the following URL for the latest info:

;; http: //www.geocities.com/davinpearson/research/2006/mopa2e.html#trashcan

;;; Known Bugs:

;;  (1) Doesn't respect make-auto-save-file-name

;;  (2) Doesn't preserve the marked files (*) in dired buffers when files as
;;      moved in or out of a trashcan directory

;;  (3) Windows detection function trashcan--is-a-windows-system could be improved
;;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
;;  NOTE: I (Joe Bloggs - vapniks@yahoo.com) have now changed this function to use
;;        the `system-type' variable since I was having problems with the original function.

;;  (4) The name of this file trashcan.el might conflict with other Lisp files

;;  (5) Richard Stallman told me that code that is to be distributed with Emacs
;;      should not use the defadvice feature.   I leave the task of removing
;;      all calls to defadvice to someone else.

;;; Code:

(defun trashcan--is-a-windows-system ()
  (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos)))

;; If above function doesn't work try using the one below instead.
;; (defun trashcan--is-a-windows-system ()
;;   (file-exists-p "c:/"))

(defun trashcan--is-a-unix-system ()

(defvar trashcan-dirname (if (trashcan--is-a-windows-system) "TRASHCAN" ".Trash")

  "This variable specifies what directory to move files into with the
\"x\" key in dired mode.  Do not add any prefix to the directory such
as \"~/\" or \"/\".

If this is a Windows system, the trashcan directories are located at
the following regexp:

       (concat \"^[a-zA-Z]:/\" (regexp-quote trashcan-dirname))

If this is a Unix system, there is one trashcan directory for
each user and ares located at the following places:

		  (concat \"~/\" trashcan-dirname)

In Windows, DO NOT give this the same name as the windows RECYCLER
directory as this will confuse the hell out of Windows.
