;;; Commentary:

;; Interfaces with paste bots via the `pbotutil.pl' utility found at
;; http://sial.org/code/perl/scripts/pbotutil.pl

;; Example usage with a custom path and nick:

;; (require 'pbotutil)
;; (setf pbotutil-command "perl ~/pbotutil.pl")
;; (setf pbotutil-nick "avar")

;;; Code:

(defvar pbotutil-command "pbotutil.pl"

  ~/pbotutil.pl\" if pbotutil.pl were not in $PATH")
(defvar pbotutil-nick ""
  "The nickname `pbotutil-region' will use by default")
(defvar pbotutil-channel "#perl"
  "The channel `pbotutil-region' will use by default")

(defvar pbotutil-prev-summary ""
  "The last summary provided. For internal use")
(defvar pbotutil-prev-channel nil
  "The last channel provided or `nil' if none. For internal use")

(defun pbotutil-region (start end &optional channel nick summary)
