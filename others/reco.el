;;; Commentary:
;;
;; 'reco' establishes a TCP connection with the server and sends an
;; HTTP request string.  The server (hopefully) responds with some
;; header information describing the streaming audio channel, some
;; audio data and then the name of the song being played (usually in
;; that order).
;;
;; Some stations like WCPE [http://wcpe.org], while giving excellent
;; broadcasts do not support title streaming over MP3 or Ogg.  Using
;; this software on such stations will only result in general station
;; information and not the artist name or title of the track being
;; played.

;;; Functionality:
;;
;; Currently supports Icecast and Shoutcast servers with Ogg and MP3
;; streams.

;;; Important Notes:
;;
;; 1) This software does not parse, cache or save audio data at
;;    all. This software downloads between of 2k-65K Bytes of data
;;    from a given streaming audio channel per call. This software is
;;    optimized to download as little as possible from a given
;;    streaming audio channel and then to immediately disconnect.
;;
;; 2) This software disregards and then discards all audio data
;;    automatically after each call.
;; 
;; 3) This software connects for a maximum of 10 seconds and then
;;    immediately disconnects. Usually the software will disconnect
;;    long before the 10 second limit is reached.
;;
;; 4) It is the responsibility of the user to read the Terms of
;;    Service of the streaming audio channel before running this
;;    software on that channel's service. Some streaming audio
;;    channels explicitly request 3rd party applications not to
;;    connect to their service. This is their prerogative. Respect it.

;;; Use:
;;
;; To use eval (reco-get URL) where URL is a string.
